# Toward a Philosophy of Sanctuary Design

## A Statement of Network Identity

*Prepared by the Network Philosophy Working Group*

---

## Preamble

The boundary archaeology community has flourished through diversity. Across the solar system, sanctuaries offer experiences ranging from meticulous historical reconstruction to evocative emotional synthesis, from high-fidelity material culture to deliberately compressed narrative arcs. This plurality is humanity's inheritance.

This document does not address the full plurality. It addresses *our* network—what we are for, what we offer, and what we do not.

---

## Two Traditions

The history of boundary archaeology reveals two broad traditions of practice, each with deep roots, each with legitimate claims to value.

### The Tradition of Historical Fidelity

Some practitioners hold that the sanctuary's purpose is *witness*: to reconstruct, as faithfully as evidence permits, what past human experience actually was. The visitor does not encounter a curator's interpretation; they encounter, as nearly as possible, *what happened*.

This tradition accepts that the past was not designed for contemporary comfort. Historical fidelity includes the uncomfortable, the dangerous, the morally complex. The dust tastes wrong because that dust *was* wrong—bitter with failure, not sweetened for palatability.

Proponents argue that only through fidelity can we truly honor the specificity of past lives. To smooth, compress, or reframe is to impose our values on people who cannot consent to the imposition. The dead deserve accuracy, not interpretation.

This is a legitimate tradition. Networks exist to serve it. **This network is not one of them.**

### The Tradition of Quintessential Experience

Other practitioners hold that the sanctuary's purpose is *transmission*: to convey the *meaning* of past experience in forms contemporary visitors can receive. Historical data is a resource, not a constraint. The sanctuary artist selects, compresses, and synthesizes—not to falsify, but to clarify.

This tradition accepts that raw experience can obscure its own significance. A visitor overwhelmed by period-accurate suffering may miss the resilience that made that suffering bearable. A visitor lost in material detail may never reach emotional truth. The essential—the quintessential—emerges through curation.

Proponents argue that fidelity without accessibility is indulgence. If visitors cannot hold the experience, they cannot learn from it. The past is honored not by replication but by understanding.

**Quintessential experience is our tradition. This is what our network exists to provide.**

---

## Our Commitment

We are not neutral between these traditions. We have chosen.

Our network exists to offer quintessential sanctuary experiences: emotionally resonant, philosophically coherent, accessible to visitors without specialized preparation. We believe this serves human flourishing. We believe it honors the past by making it *receivable*.

We do not claim our tradition is superior. We do not argue that other networks should adopt it. We simply state what we are.

---

## The Question of Safety

Our commitment to quintessential experience entails a commitment to visitor safety—physical and emotional.

The past was dangerous. Hunger, cold, injury, disease—these were daily realities for our ancestors. Some sanctuaries reconstruct these dangers faithfully, offering visitors the genuine possibility of harm under informed consent protocols.

**Our network does not offer such experiences.**

We believe that emotional depth does not require physical danger. Visitors in our sanctuaries may feel the *weight* of historical suffering—fatigue, discomfort, exposure, the texture of hardship—without bearing its bodily consequences. Minor discomforts are part of the experience: sunburn, muscle strain, blisters, insect stings. But we do not permit injuries that require medical intervention. We do not permit broken bones. We do not permit lasting physical or emotional harm.

Recovery is always available. The exit is always accessible. This is not a limitation of our sanctuaries; it is their *design*.

---

## What This Means

If you seek quintessential experience—emotional resonance, philosophical clarity, accessible depth—our network welcomes you. We have built something beautiful, and we invite you to share it.

If you seek historical fidelity with authentic physical risk—the genuine possibility of injury, the removal of safety guarantees—other networks exist to serve that need. We respect those networks. We do not compete with them. We simply offer something different.

Our sanctuaries are not cages. They are gardens. We tend them with care, and we invite you to walk through them.

But gardens have walls. The wall defines the garden as much as the flowers do.

---

## Conclusion

We are custodians of human memory. We help the living understand the dead, and through that understanding, themselves.

Our network has chosen how to do this work: through quintessential experience, through emotional accessibility, through safety that enables depth. This is our identity. This is our offering.

We do not ask others to make the same choice. We only ask that our choice be respected, and that those who join our network do so knowing what we are.
