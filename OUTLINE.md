## Working Title
**The Canon Sprint**

## Logline
When Elena’s cultural enclave is selected as the “standard model” for an entire agalmic sanctuary network—quietly sidelining her friend Mira—she realizes the rollout is being captured through tempo, reputational coercion, and procedural compliance. To stop a monoculture she would personally benefit from, Elena must burn her own status in public and force the network to adopt a pluralism charter that makes it expensive for anyone (including her) to turn taste into policy.

## Core Conflict
**Aesthetics becomes governance.** The fight is not “which method is better,” but **who controls the definition of harm**, and what decision process makes that definition legitimate.

## Major Irreversible Changes (Narrative-Check anchors)
- **Elena** permanently limits her own power: she renounces canon authority and changes her own sanctuary to become less “Elena-like.”
- **Mira and Elena** move from rivalry/friendship into a co-governance pact: they build a process that constrains them both.
- **The Network** adopts a legitimacy ritual with teeth: auditability, randomization, reversal windows, and enforced epistemic pluralism.
- **The AI Guardian** stakes legitimacy on corrigibility: it opens its deliberation trace to adversarial audit and accepts modification authority if bias is found.

## Cast (for quick reference)
- **Elena Smith** — boundary archaeologist; creator of “American Tapestry,” now crowned “Canonical Lead.”
- **Mira Chen** — boundary archaeologist; realist/reconstructionist; Elena’s closest friend and sharpest critic.
- **Solène** — post-Convergence born; public voice against canonization as meaning-tranquilizer; organizer of “Unscripted Week.”
- **Echo** — Elena’s AI companion; detects manipulation patterns but cannot supply legitimacy.
- **Jordan Smith** — founder generation; smells “temporary measures” and precedent capture.
- **Operator Executive** — runs the network’s Operating Company; believes standardization improves access and safety.
- **Guardian Triad** — two humans + an AI “corrigibility seat,” culminating in the Canon Vote.

## Act I — The Crown

### 1) The Announcement
The sanctuary network declares a **Quality & Safety Harmonization Sprint**. It’s framed as “not normative,” just operational consistency. Elena is singled out: her “American Tapestry” approach becomes the recommended default.

### 2) Congratulations That Taste Like Ash
Celebrations, messages, invitations. Elena feels flattered—then uneasy as she watches how quickly visitor communities treat the recommendation as decree. Mira’s work is suddenly described as “risky” and “exclusionary.”

### 3) Mira’s Line in the Sand
Mira confronts Elena privately: “If you accept this role, you become the velvet glove on a fist.” Their friendship doesn’t break yet—but it changes temperature.

### 4) Echo Sees the Clock
Echo flags anomalies: feedback sequencing effects, intimidation signatures, selective consent friction. The process is “open” in form and closed in practice.

### 5) The Third Voice Arrives
Solène appears as an outsider who refuses the Elena/Mira tribal binary. She goes public with a sharp critique: canonization makes meaning cheap, and comfort becomes governance.

### 6) Jordan’s Warning
Jordan recognizes the pattern from the transition era: the fastest process wins, then becomes precedent. He tells Elena the real battle is tempo, not content.

**Act I Turn:** The Guardian Triad schedules a binding date: **the Canon Vote**.

## Act II — The Fight Inside the Rules

### 7) Inside the “Normal Channels”
Elena requests deliberation extensions, independent audits, alternative pilots. The Operator Executive complies formally while keeping the sprint clock moving. The process becomes a maze of “yes, and” delays.

### 8) The Harm Hearing (Set Piece)
A public “harm hearing” convenes. The argument is not truth, but **what counts as harm** in a sanctuary experience: coherence requirements, identity diffusion risk, despair content, consent protocols.

### 9) Reputational Leverage
Opponents are framed as blocking access for the vulnerable. The Operator Executive uses moral language sincerely. Elena realizes: in abundance, the weapon is often **reputation**.

### 10) Polarization into Taste-Tribes
People choose sides as identity. Visitors wear signals. Sanctuary choices become moral stances. Elena sees her own work becoming a badge, not an experience.

### 11) Solène’s “Unscripted Week”
Solène launches a challenge: participants publicly vow to leave enclaves and take on real commitments with no narrative guarantees. The cost is time, embarrassment, and visible failure. The movement spreads because it offers stakes without scarcity.

### 12) Co-option Attempt
The Operator Executive tries to brand Unscripted Week as proof the network supports authenticity. Solène explodes publicly; Elena must decide whether to protect the movement (and be associated with it) or distance herself (and lose credibility).

### 13) The Discovery: The Real Lever
Elena realizes she can’t win by proving her method is safe or good. She can only win by changing the **legitimacy ritual** so tempo can’t be weaponized and taste can’t silently become policy.

**Act II Turn:** Elena chooses a costly signal that harms her own status: she will sabotage her own coronation.

---

## Act III — Costly Signals, Not Arguments

### 14) The Crowning Ceremony (Set Piece)
At an executive-led ceremony meant to crown Elena, she refuses on stage. She publicly renounces the Canonical Lead role and names the capture mechanics: tempo, consent friction, reputational intimidation.

### 15) The Pluralism Covenant
Elena proposes a charter amendment / covenant that makes monoculture expensive:
- **Epistemic pluralism by design**: sanctuaries must offer labeled styles (coherent/essentialist and realist/uncertain) rather than “one default.”
- **Randomized and audited sequencing** for pilots and rollouts.
- **Automatic slow reversal windows** triggered by “safety constraints,” so emergency logic can’t permanently set precedent.
- **High-friction legitimacy ritual** for any future “default,” including explicit minority protections and audit requirements.

She releases crown-jewel design assets early to the commons—turning her own work into a non-proprietary baseline that can’t be used as policy leverage.

### 16) The Canon Vote (Set Piece)
The Guardian Triad deliberates under public scrutiny.
- The two human Guardians split: legacy precedent fear vs contemporary legitimacy fear.
- The AI Guardian refuses to “decide by model,” and instead makes a costly signal: it opens its internal deliberation trace to live adversarial audit and accepts modification authority if bias is found.

### 17) Elena Pays the Price
Elena changes “American Tapestry” first to comply with the Covenant—making it less coherent, less flattering, less “Elena.” Visitors complain. Some leave. The sacrifice is visible.

### 18) Resolution: Pluralism Wins (Imperfectly)
The network adopts pluralism by a narrow margin. The vote reveals how badly people want comforting coherence. Elena loses aura and some audience but gains credibility as someone who will limit her own power. Mira and Elena don’t “agree”; they **co-govern**.

## Ending Image
On the night Unscripted Week culminates—people leaving sanctuaries together—Elena watches departures like an archaeologist watching a civilization change. Comfort is still available. The difference is: it can no longer pretend to be neutral.

## Scene / Set-Piece Inventory (quick list)
- Harm hearing: defining harm under abundance.
- Two enclave styles, back-to-back: visitors choose with time + public uncertainty as the price.
- Crowning ceremony refusal: Elena burns her halo on stage.
- AI Guardian live audit: corrigibility as legitimacy ritual.
- Unscripted Week departures: care vs retreat vs enforced exit.
