# Chapter 00 Revisions Needed

## 1. Jordan's Age and Appearance

**Current text:**
> "Jordan Smith stood beside her, fifty-eight years old with the body of a man half that age—one of the first generation to truly benefit from the longevity"

**Issues:**
- Inconsistent with Chapter 15, where Jordan is 75 and "looked about sixty" (15 years younger). Here he's 58 and looks 29 (29 years younger).
- "First generation to truly benefit" at 58 in ~2028 (one year into the Convergence) while already looking half his age seems too aggressive for early tech.

**Needed:** Revise appearance description to be consistent with Chapter 15 and plausible for early-stage longevity treatments.

## 2. "Things had cost money"

**Current text:**
> "I know." Elena had heard this before. The world had been different. Things had cost money.

**Issues:**
- Creates a false binary (before: money / after: no money).
- Per WORLD.md, physical goods, transit, prime real estate, and physical sanctuary visits still cost something in the main timeline. The transformation shifted *where* scarcity lives, not eliminated it.

**Needed:** Revise to reflect more nuanced understanding of what changed (essential needs now covered, information free, physical goods dramatically cheaper but not free).

## 3. Echo as Universal Basic Services

**Current text:**
> "part of the Universal Basic Services that had rolled out so quickly it felt like weather"

**Issues:**
- Unclear whether personal AI companions would be part of UBS (vs. personal choice/acquisition).
- Timeline claim ("rolled out so quickly it felt like weather") may not align with established Convergence timeline.
- Thematically: Dad would have cared about the choice to give Elena an AI companion. This should be something Dad did deliberately, not a public service default.

**Needed:** Revise to frame Echo as a deliberate choice by Jordan, not a UBS allocation.

## 4. Mammoths and Timeline

**Current text:**
> "Just last year, none of this existed. Not the wolves, not the mammoths, not the understanding of ancient DNA that let us fill in the gaps with modern templates. The Convergence changed everything."

**Issues:**
- Adult mammoths are visible in the scene, but mammoths take years to gestate and grow to adulthood.
- "Bioprinting" (instant creation of adult animals) is not established canon.
- If this is ~2028 (one year into the Convergence), you cannot have adult mammoths that were created "just last year."

**Needed:** Revise to account for the established timeline:
- First mammoths born ~2027 (pre-Convergence biotech, expensive and slow)
- Chapter 00 is ~2028, so mammoths are only ~1 year old (calves, not adults)
- Jordan's dialogue should reflect that de-extinction predates the Convergence; the Convergence will make it *scalable*, but these first animals are products of decades of traditional genetic engineering
- The scene should show mammoth calves, not full-grown adults, or push the flashback later (e.g., Elena at 15, ~2032) to allow for adult animals
