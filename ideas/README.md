# Ideas

This folder contains **ideas under consideration**. Nothing here is canon.

The canonical sources remain:
- `WORLD.md`
- `CHARACTERS.md`
- `OUTLINE.md`
- `PREMISE.md`

Ideas may be implemented, modified, or discarded. If an idea is accepted, the relevant canon file(s) should be updated and the idea file can be deleted or archived.
