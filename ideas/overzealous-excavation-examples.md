# Historical Examples of Overzealous Excavation

This file collects real-world examples where excavation destroyed irreplaceable context—potential material to illustrate the "deferral debate" in chapter 9.

## Troy (Heinrich Schliemann, 1870s)

The most famous example. Schliemann was obsessed with finding Homer's Troy and "Priam's treasure." He dug a massive trench straight through the mound, destroying multiple occupation layers in his haste to reach the oldest levels. Later archaeologists determined that the layer he identified as Homeric Troy (Troy II) was actually a thousand years too early—and that the layers he'd demolished likely contained the actual Bronze Age city he was seeking. His methods were so destructive that subsequent excavators spent decades trying to reconstruct what he'd obliterated.

**Useful angle:** The irony that eagerness to *know* destroyed the ability to know correctly.

## Nineveh and early Near Eastern archaeology (mid-1800s)

Austen Henry Layard and others excavated Assyrian palaces with tunnel-and-trench methods that prioritized dramatic finds (stone reliefs, colossal statues) over stratigraphic context. Workers were often paid per artifact, incentivizing rapid, careless digging. Entire occupation sequences were shoveled aside as "fill." The result: museums full of spectacular objects with minimal information about how they related to each other or to the buildings they came from.

**Useful angle:** Institutional pressures (museum collections, national prestige) driving destructive haste.

## Pompeii (18th-19th century)

Early excavations at Pompeii treated the site as a quarry for art objects. Frescoes were cut from walls; mosaics were lifted; anything "uninteresting" was discarded or left to decay. The spatial relationships that could have told us how Romans actually lived—where objects sat in rooms, how spaces connected—were obliterated in favor of display pieces. Modern archaeologists working at Pompeii are often studying what earlier excavators left behind or damaged.

**Useful angle:** The tragedy of treating a site as a source of *things* rather than *information*.

## General pattern

In each case:
1. Technology and methods were limited
2. Excavators prioritized dramatic finds over context
3. Information was permanently lost
4. Later generations, with better tools, could only mourn what was gone

The deferral debate asks: if we *know* our tools will improve, is it ethical to dig now and accept the loss—or should we wait?
