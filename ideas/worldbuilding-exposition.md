# Worldbuilding Exposition

**Source:** Reader feedback

## Problem

Key elements of the world are not described well enough. Readers—especially those less familiar with science fiction tropes—may feel lost.

## Goal

Communicate essential worldbuilding in a way that still makes for good storytelling. Avoid info-dumps; find natural moments for exposition.

## Concepts Not Yet Established

### Tier 1: Should Be Clear by End of Chapter 1

| Concept | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Rotating cylinder habitats** | The "horizon that curved gently upward" and "thirty kilometers... wrapped around the interior of her cylinder" are mentioned, but readers unfamiliar with O'Neill cylinders may not grasp that this is a constructed world in space. Needs clearer grounding. |
| **The Great Convergence** | Named ("remembered the world before the Convergence") but never explained. What changed? When? Why does it matter? |
| **Post-scarcity economics** | Implied throughout but never stated. Why do visitors travel for days to experience curated hardship? The premise only makes sense if material struggle has ended. |
| **Longevity/life extension** | Never explicitly stated that people live much longer. Elena is 28, has worked with Echo for 17 years (since age 11), but later chapters suggest she has "decades of experience" as a founder. The math needs the reader to understand extended lifespans. |

### Tier 2: Should Be Clear by End of Chapter 6

| Concept | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **AI swarm deliberation** | Ch 3 mentions "the swarm deliberated in under three seconds" but this is opaque. What is a swarm? How do they deliberate? This becomes crucial in Ch 6 but is introduced without context. |
| **Zero-point ethics** | Ch 6 references consequentialism, deontology, and "zero-point ethics" but the last is never explained. Readers unfamiliar with the term will be lost. |

## Concepts Underexplained Throughout

| Concept | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Universal Basic Services** | Mentioned in WORLD.md but never in the novel. How does anyone afford to live? To travel? |
| **Earth vs space populations** | The novel mentions billions in both, but the relationship between them is unclear. |
| **NPCs / behavioral models** | Used in Ch 1, 2, 3. Are these AI-driven simulations? Robots? The Morrison family "dies" but they're not real—this is never clarified for readers. |
| **Physical vs virtual sanctuary access** | WORLD.md explains this spectrum carefully. The novel mentions virtual access exists but never explains the distinction or why physical presence matters. |
| **Why human-designed sanctuaries matter** | Why not just have AI create them? The "hand-knit sweater" analogy from WORLD.md never appears. |
| **The timeline** | When is this? How long since the Convergence? |
| **Boundary archaeology as a discipline** | Named by Kenji, but the etymology ("we're standing at a cliff...") from WORLD.md never appears in the novel. |
| **Canalization** | Used in Ch 8 and 19 as professional terminology. Never defined. |

## Structural Notes

**Chapter 1** bears the heaviest burden. It must establish:
- We are in space, in an artificial habitat
- This is a post-scarcity world
- People live much longer than today
- Sanctuaries exist to recreate pre-abundance experiences

**The Delgados** (Ch 1) are the natural vehicle for exposition. They're new to the sanctuary; Elena could think about what they need to understand. The parents "remembered the world before the Convergence"—this is an opportunity to explain what changed.

**Jordan's arrival** (Ch 15) naturally introduces costly signaling theory. This works well—a new character bringing a new framework.
