# Worldbuilding Exposition Gaps

This document lists world/tech/governance concepts that the manuscript mentions or relies on without clear, reader-facing explanation—especially for readers unfamiliar with common SF tropes.

- **Scope**: only the *gaps*. If something is already established clearly in-scene, it's not listed.
- **Goal**: identify (1) the gap and (2) where in the story the gap first appears (the point where a reader would first be confused).

## Chapter 19 — *The New Project*

- **"Comfort dampeners"**
  - **What shows up**: Elena "dials up her comfort dampeners."
  - **The gap**: What comfort dampeners are (neural modulation? medication? mesh feature?) and whether they're common.

- **Operator access revocation after trust transfer**
  - **What shows up**: Mira can't adjust her resort anymore; she's "a guest."
  - **The gap**: That ownership/control is access-controlled. Without earlier setup, this emotional beat requires readers to reverse-engineer how "operator permissions" work.
