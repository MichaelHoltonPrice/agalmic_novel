# Worldbuilding Exposition

**Source:** Reader feedback

## Problem

Key elements of the world are not described well enough. Readers—especially those less familiar with science fiction tropes—may feel lost.

Examples of concepts that need clearer introduction:
- Space habitats
- (others to be identified)

## Goal

Communicate essential worldbuilding in a way that still makes for good storytelling. Avoid info-dumps; find natural moments for exposition.

## Next Steps

1. Identify the specific concepts readers need to understand
2. Review existing chapters for opportunities to weave in exposition
3. Draft revisions that integrate world details organically
