# Worldbuilding Exposition Gaps

This document lists world/tech/governance concepts that the manuscript mentions or relies on without clear, reader-facing explanation—especially for readers unfamiliar with common SF tropes.

- **Scope**: only the *gaps*. If something is already established clearly in-scene, it's not listed.
- **Goal**: identify (1) the gap and (2) where in the story the gap first appears (the point where a reader would first be confused).

## Chapter 16 — *The Signal*

- **Light-speed delay as an active constraint**
  - **What shows up**: enumeration coordination slowed by minutes of light delay.
  - **The gap**: That the solar system is *big* and coordination is delay-bound. This feels like a sudden physics lecture without earlier setup.

- **Smart contracts / "cryptographically locked"**
  - **What shows up**: contract is irreversible; executes automatically; proof published.
  - **The gap**: What a smart contract is in this world (a self-executing legal/technical commitment), and why it's trusted more than institutions.

- **"Open chain"**
  - **What shows up**: open chain dashboard; AI news agents monitor it; permanent record.
  - **The gap**: What the "open chain" is (an auditable public information layer with open algorithms, contrasted with proprietary feeds).

- **Agalmic Commons Trust**
  - **What shows up**: infrastructure transfers to a trust funding universal basic services.
  - **The gap**: What a "trust" means here (public-benefit institution) and how the dividend/UBS works in daily life.

## Chapter 17 — *Interlude*

- **What it means for the Executive that models were "probability zero"**
  - **What shows up**: swarm modeling predicted no such curve.
  - **The gap**: How governance is usually modeled/managed, so "probability zero" lands as an institutional shock rather than just a dramatic line.

## Chapter 18 — *The Climb*

- **The User Veto as a real, binding mechanism**
  - **What shows up**: threshold reached; proposal blocked; window still open; then contract executes at closure.
  - **The gap**: What "blocked" means operationally (proposal nullified? implementation halted?), and why the window stays open after threshold is reached.

## Chapter 19 — *The New Project*

- **"Comfort dampeners"**
  - **What shows up**: Elena "dials up her comfort dampeners."
  - **The gap**: What comfort dampeners are (neural modulation? medication? mesh feature?) and whether they're common.

- **Operator access revocation after trust transfer**
  - **What shows up**: Mira can't adjust her resort anymore; she's "a guest."
  - **The gap**: That ownership/control is access-controlled. Without earlier setup, this emotional beat requires readers to reverse-engineer how "operator permissions" work.
