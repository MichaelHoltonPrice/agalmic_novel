# Worldbuilding Exposition Gaps

This document lists world/tech/governance concepts that the manuscript mentions or relies on without clear, reader-facing explanation—especially for readers unfamiliar with common SF tropes.

- **Scope**: only the *gaps*. If something is already established clearly in-scene, it's not listed.
- **Goal**: identify (1) the gap and (2) where in the story the gap first appears (the point where a reader would first be confused).

---

## Chapter 1 — *The Sanctuary*

- **Boundary sanctuaries / "sanctuary" as a concept**
  - **What shows up**: Elena is calibrating historical hardship experiences for paying visitors.
  - **The gap**: The reader doesn't learn what a sanctuary *is* (curated historical hardship as a voluntary experience), how common they are, or why people seek them out.

- **The setting is a rotating space habitat ("cylinder")**
  - **What shows up**: "thirty kilometers… wrapped around the interior of her cylinder," a horizon that "curved," an artificial sky.
  - **The gap**: It isn't unmistakably clear that this is a giant rotating space habitat in orbit, not a valley, dome, or VR simulation. The fact that rotation provides "gravity" is never stated.

- **Augmentation baseline: Elena's external augmentation vs "cortical mesh"**
  - **What shows up**: Elena wears glasses/earbuds; "Most people her age had cortical mesh…"
  - **The gap**: What cortical mesh *is* (a brain/neural interface), what it does day-to-day, and why Elena's choice of external augmentation is unusual or philosophically meaningful.

- **Echo: what kind of AI is this, in-world?**
  - **What shows up**: Echo speaks as a companion; has deep access to systems; "barely a year old" in 2028-ish framing.
  - **The gap**: Whether Echo is a personal assistant, a legally-recognized person, a distributed "swarm," etc.—and why its presence is culturally normal.

- **Biometric "intake profile" + emotional baselines**
  - **What shows up**: cortisol signatures, heart/breathing baselines used to pace experiences.
  - **The gap**: How the sanctuary is allowed to read this data (visitor consent? standard practice?) and whether it comes from wearables, implants, or the environment.

- **"NPCs / behavioral models" in a physical space**
  - **What shows up**: Morrison family is staged, appears like "people," later called NPCs in Ch2.
  - **The gap**: What these "NPCs" *are* physically (robots? bio-constructs? projected avatars? actors?) and how visitors perceive them (do they know? is it disclosed?).

- **"Convergence" as a historical hinge**
  - **What shows up**: characters casually reference "the Convergence" and "scarcity" vs "abundance."
  - **The gap**: What the Convergence was (the swift transition to post-scarcity via AI/automation, starting around 2027) and when it happened relative to the present day.

- **Virtual vs physical access gradient**
  - **What shows up**: "virtually—millions did… streamed free to anyone with cortical mesh—but they'd chosen to come here in person."
  - **The gap**: Why physical presence (embodied travel taking days) still matters culturally when virtual access is free and nearly identical.

- **Post-scarcity economics / Universal Basic Services**
  - **What shows up**: implied by the entire premise (people travel for days to experience hardship).
  - **The gap**: How people afford to live, travel, and pursue vocations without traditional jobs. The economic foundation of the world is never stated.

- **Human longevity**
  - **What shows up**: Elena is 28 and has worked with Echo for 17 years; later she is treated as a peer to "founders" who remember the pre-Convergence world.
  - **The gap**: That aging has been solved and humans can live centuries. Without this, Elena's timeline and status are confusing.

---

## Chapter 2 — *The Visit*

- **"Cortics" terminology**
  - **What shows up**: Solène's "cortics" feed her contextual overlays; she can "dim" them.
  - **The gap**: What "cortics" means (shorthand for cortical mesh/interface) and how the experience feels (inner voice? overlay? shared attention?).

- **How a visitor "arrives" at a sanctuary (transit pod / arrival bay)**
  - **What shows up**: transit pods, arrival bays, cylinders in space.
  - **The gap**: Where her body is coming from (Earth? station? another habitat?) and what "travel" means in this era (hours vs days, routine vs rare).

- **"Most sanctuaries hosted multiple groups" / personalization**
  - **What shows up**: Solène is alone; she infers it's personalized.
  - **The gap**: The operating model for sanctuaries (booked like resorts? theme-parks with concurrent groups? algorithmically tailored?).

- **What is "historical context info" and where does it come from?**
  - **What shows up**: cortics provide dates/routes/mortality stats automatically.
  - **The gap**: Whether this is public metadata, sanctuary-provided, or a universal info-net—i.e., what "knowledge access" looks like in this world.

---

## Chapter 3 — *The Incident*

- **Consent tiers: "safe-tier" vs "permissive-tier"**
  - **What shows up**: a fork with two options, then "permissive-tier removes most intervention protocols."
  - **The gap**: What makes "permissive-tier" legally/morally permitted in this society (why it exists, what the boundaries are, who sets them).

- **"The habitat will not soften consequences" (what can actually hurt you?)**
  - **What shows up**: scorpion, centipedes, death adders, infection risk.
  - **The gap**: Whether the dangers are real biology, engineered approximations, or controlled simulations. A non-SF reader may not know how literal the stakes are.

- **Proto-language reconstruction**
  - **What shows up**: reconstructed Proto-Oceanic song with glosses.
  - **The gap**: How language reconstruction is done here (AI inference? scholarly debate?) and whether visitors are hearing "best guess" vs "authentic recording."

- **Medical extraction drone + "network safety systems" authority**
  - **What shows up**: drone arrives; operator says "the swarm flagged… I don't have authority to override."
  - **The gap**: What "the network" is (a membership org? platform? regulator?) and why it can override a signed consent choice.

- **"AI swarm deliberated in under three seconds"**
  - **What shows up**: swarm does ethical triage instantly.
  - **The gap**: That "your AI" is often a committee of many AIs (a swarm), not a single mind. The concept is introduced mid-crisis without grounding.

- **Healing in two hours**
  - **What shows up**: broken ankle → fully healed quickly.
  - **The gap**: The baseline medical tech (nanomedicine/regeneration) and how routine it is. Without this, the healing reads as magic.

---

## Chapter 4 — *The Proposal*

- **What is a "governance proposal" in this world?**
  - **What shows up**: proposals arrive monthly; sanctuaries "approve" rapidly; numbers climb.
  - **The gap**: Who votes (operators? users?), what "approval" means (binding? advisory?), and why tens of thousands can approve in hours.

- **Network structure: "membership" and "shared infrastructure"**
  - **What shows up**: identity systems, consent protocols, discovery services, safety tooling; "delisted" risk.
  - **The gap**: What the network provides that is *scarce* (trust/brand/data), and what happens to an operator outside it.

- **"Network Philosophy Working Group" appearing from nowhere**
  - **What shows up**: an influential manifesto by an unfamiliar group with no public record.
  - **The gap**: Whether this is normal (working groups are common) or suspicious (new entity with outsized power).

- **Tempo / "capture-by-tempo"**
  - **What shows up**: Elena cites her father's phrase; 45 vs 180 days.
  - **The gap**: The concept itself ("moving faster than opposition can organize").

---

## Chapter 5 — *The Safety Case*

- **Who/what is "the Executive"?**
  - **What shows up**: institutional leader with staff, authority to access deliberation logs.
  - **The gap**: What institution he leads (Operating Company? regulator? network HQ) and what powers he has vs doesn't.

- **What is an "autonomy committee"?**
  - **What shows up**: routing of complaints; escalation options.
  - **The gap**: The governance layers (committees, audits, appeals) that make up the institutional machinery.

- **Privacy protocols + why he can see what he sees**
  - **What shows up**: "privacy protocols limited cross-entity access, but as Executive…"
  - **The gap**: What "entities" are here (individual sanctuaries? users? the network) and what the privacy norm is in a post-scarcity/augmentation society.

---

## Chapter 6 — *Grokking the Swarm*

- **The deliberation log interface & interpretability**
  - **What shows up**: 127 AIs, 8,347 exchanges; unreadable raw logs; needs analysis AI.
  - **The gap**: That swarm reasoning is logged and auditable but not human-readable without tools. This is a brand-new governance premise dropped mid-chapter.

- **"Zero-point ethics"**
  - **What shows up**: introduced as a major framework, but it's unclear whether humans know it, endorse it, or fear it.
  - **The gap**: What zero-point reasoning is (catastrophic tail risks / multiplicative survival) and its origins.

- **Self-modifying AIs / quantum randomness / nondeterminism**
  - **What shows up**: irreproducibility of deliberations.
  - **The gap**: The distinction between "we can simulate outcomes reliably" vs "we can't replay minds exactly," and why that matters for legitimacy.

---

## Chapter 7 — *Pathos*

- **Why "quintessential experience" is being treated as network identity**
  - **What shows up**: philosophical choice + safety are conflated; staff discuss it.
  - **The gap**: Why a network would enforce a single "tradition" rather than just safety limits—i.e., what "network identity" means operationally (branding, trust, discoverability).

- **Logos/Ethos/Pathos framing**
  - **What shows up**: rhetorical triangle appears as an analytic tool.
  - **The gap**: Not a worldbuilding gap per se, but some readers may need contextualization that this is *his* professional lens, not authorial lecturing.

---

## Chapter 8 — *The Beach*

- **Kenji's "ambient systems" creating AR overlays in corridors**
  - **What shows up**: yellow brick road in 90 seconds.
  - **The gap**: What AR "permissioning" is (who can paint overlays where), and what's physical vs visual-only.

- **"Canalization" used as in-group jargon**
  - **What shows up**: Elena canalizes transitions; Mira keeps worlds separate.
  - **The gap**: What canalization means (using geography/gradients to guide movement without signs).

- **Biosecurity / containment stack for dangerous ecologies**
  - **What shows up**: layered containment (trenches, microclimates) later referenced.
  - **The gap**: How multiple biomes with hazards can coexist in one cylinder without cross-contamination.

---

## Chapter 9 — *The Deep Past*

- **"Death adders" as *real* hazards**
  - **What shows up**: venomous snake nearly stepped on; "glasses on high-alert."
  - **The gap**: Whether "high-alert" means automated hazard detection, and whether the snake is real biology or a designed analogue.

- **Mainland New Guinea Lapita sites / the "deferral debate"**
  - **What shows up**: ethical debate about destructive excavation; hinted history.
  - **The gap**: Why excavation is irreversible (you destroy context), and why "waiting for better tools" is plausible in this future.

- **AI villagers / "indistinguishable from human"**
  - **What shows up**: "AI-driven… indistinguishable from human."
  - **The gap**: What these are physically (robots with synthetic skin? bio-printed bodies? projected avatars with haptics?).

---

## Chapter 10 — *The Gathering*

- **"Buffalo ate the eastern wing" (implied physical simulation failures)**
  - **What shows up**: joke implies large animals are present and can physically damage builds.
  - **The gap**: That these sanctuaries can include large, physically real animals/ecologies and that "failure modes" are physical, not just software bugs.

---

## Chapter 11 — *The Plan*

- **Guardian Triad / User Veto mechanics**
  - **What shows up**: introduced as core plot machinery; "unanimous vote" claim here conflicts with later 2–1 outcome.
  - **The gap**:
    - What the Triad is (oversight body).
    - What it takes to veto (unanimous vs majority—currently inconsistent with Ch 13).
    - What the User Veto is and why eligibility requires "two physical visits."

---

## Chapter 12 — *The Critique*

- **"Pen and paper" as a deliberate constraint**
  - **What shows up**: Solène insists on no AI assist; cortics can be "silenced."
  - **The gap**: What AI-assisted writing is normally like in this world, and why "unassisted" is morally salient.

- **Wanderer's Rest / L5**
  - **What shows up**: a location marker that assumes familiarity (Lagrange points).
  - **The gap**: What "L5" refers to (e.g., "a hostel cluster at the Earth–Moon L5 Lagrange point").

---

## Chapter 13 — *The Guardian Appeal*

- **Triad Chamber / separate orbits**
  - **What shows up**: separate station, separate orbit, deliberate independence.
  - **The gap**: Why physical separation matters in a world of remote presence (legitimacy theater? security? independence).

- **AI Guardian as a "presence"**
  - **What shows up**: no body; geometric projection.
  - **The gap**: Whether this is a projection of a remote entity, an AI running locally on the station, or a committee/swarm presented as one voice.

---

## Chapter 14 — *The Low Point*

- **User Veto telemetry vs "resolution window" timing**
  - **What shows up**: countdown and closing windows; "ten days" vs other timings.
  - **The gap**: The governance timeline (operator vote closes → veto window closes → implementation). The plot depends on this and casual readers may get lost.

- **Attention economy as a background force**
  - **What shows up**: "attention is the constraint," but "how" is mostly implied until Ch16.
  - **The gap**: That attention is scarce despite material abundance, and that most people's feeds are AI-curated—so "indifference" isn't apathy, it's infrastructure.

---

## Chapter 15 — *The Decision*

- **"Swarm" as Kenji's personal toolchain**
  - **What shows up**: Kenji has a swarm of agents that brainstorm adversarially.
  - **The gap**: Whether this is normal personal augmentation (everyone has a swarm) or Kenji's special expertise.

- **Jordan living on Mercury (and why that's normal)**
  - **What shows up**: "lived on Mercury," matter-of-fact.
  - **The gap**: That off-Earth living is normal (habitats, life support, radiation shielding, etc.).

---

## Chapter 16 — *The Signal*

- **Light-speed delay as an active constraint**
  - **What shows up**: enumeration coordination slowed by minutes of light delay.
  - **The gap**: That the solar system is *big* and coordination is delay-bound. This feels like a sudden physics lecture without earlier setup.

- **Smart contracts / "cryptographically locked"**
  - **What shows up**: contract is irreversible; executes automatically; proof published.
  - **The gap**: What a smart contract is in this world (a self-executing legal/technical commitment), and why it's trusted more than institutions.

- **"Open chain"**
  - **What shows up**: open chain dashboard; AI news agents monitor it; permanent record.
  - **The gap**: What the "open chain" is (an auditable public information layer with open algorithms, contrasted with proprietary feeds).

- **Agalmic Commons Trust**
  - **What shows up**: infrastructure transfers to a trust funding universal basic services.
  - **The gap**: What a "trust" means here (public-benefit institution) and how the dividend/UBS works in daily life.

---

## Chapter 17 — *Interlude*

- **What it means for the Executive that models were "probability zero"**
  - **What shows up**: swarm modeling predicted no such curve.
  - **The gap**: How governance is usually modeled/managed, so "probability zero" lands as an institutional shock rather than just a dramatic line.

---

## Chapter 18 — *The Climb*

- **The User Veto as a real, binding mechanism**
  - **What shows up**: threshold reached; proposal blocked; window still open; then contract executes at closure.
  - **The gap**: What "blocked" means operationally (proposal nullified? implementation halted?), and why the window stays open after threshold is reached.

---

## Chapter 19 — *The New Project*

- **"Comfort dampeners"**
  - **What shows up**: Elena "dials up her comfort dampeners."
  - **The gap**: What comfort dampeners are (neural modulation? medication? mesh feature?) and whether they're common.

- **Operator access revocation after trust transfer**
  - **What shows up**: Mira can't adjust her resort anymore; she's "a guest."
  - **The gap**: That ownership/control is access-controlled. Without earlier setup, this emotional beat requires readers to reverse-engineer how "operator permissions" work.

---

## Consistency Note

- **Guardian Triad veto rule**: Chapter 11 states the Triad veto requires a **unanimous** vote; Chapter 13 shows a **2–1** decision being sufficient to deny the appeal (and implies a 2–1 could have granted it). This is a direct contradiction in core plot machinery.
