# Worldbuilding Exposition Gaps

This document lists world/tech/governance concepts that the manuscript mentions or relies on without clear, reader-facing explanation—especially for readers unfamiliar with common SF tropes.

- **Scope**: only the *gaps*. If something is already established clearly in-scene, it's not listed.
- **Goal**: identify (1) the gap and (2) where in the story the gap first appears (the point where a reader would first be confused).

---

## Chapter 8 — *The Beach*

- **Kenji's "ambient systems" creating AR overlays in corridors**
  - **What shows up**: yellow brick road in 90 seconds.
  - **The gap**: What AR "permissioning" is (who can paint overlays where), and what's physical vs visual-only.

- **"Canalization" used as in-group jargon**
  - **What shows up**: Elena canalizes transitions; Mira keeps worlds separate.
  - **The gap**: What canalization means (using geography/gradients to guide movement without signs).

- **Biosecurity / containment stack for dangerous ecologies**
  - **What shows up**: layered containment (trenches, microclimates) later referenced.
  - **The gap**: How multiple biomes with hazards can coexist in one cylinder without cross-contamination.

---

## Chapter 9 — *The Deep Past*

- **"Death adders" as *real* hazards**
  - **What shows up**: venomous snake nearly stepped on; "glasses on high-alert."
  - **The gap**: Whether "high-alert" means automated hazard detection, and whether the snake is real biology or a designed analogue.

- **Mainland New Guinea Lapita sites / the "deferral debate"**
  - **What shows up**: ethical debate about destructive excavation; hinted history.
  - **The gap**: Why excavation is irreversible (you destroy context), and why "waiting for better tools" is plausible in this future.

- **AI villagers / "indistinguishable from human"**
  - **What shows up**: "AI-driven… indistinguishable from human."
  - **The gap**: What these are physically (robots with synthetic skin? bio-printed bodies? projected avatars with haptics?).

---

## Chapter 10 — *The Gathering*

- **"Buffalo ate the eastern wing" (implied physical simulation failures)**
  - **What shows up**: joke implies large animals are present and can physically damage builds.
  - **The gap**: That these sanctuaries can include large, physically real animals/ecologies and that "failure modes" are physical, not just software bugs.

---

## Chapter 11 — *The Plan*

- **Guardian Triad / User Veto mechanics**
  - **What shows up**: introduced as core plot machinery.
  - **The gap**:
    - What the Triad is (oversight body).
    - What the User Veto is and why eligibility requires "two physical visits."

---

## Chapter 12 — *The Critique*

- **"Pen and paper" as a deliberate constraint**
  - **What shows up**: Solène insists on no AI assist; cortics can be "silenced."
  - **The gap**: What AI-assisted writing is normally like in this world, and why "unassisted" is morally salient.

- **Wanderer's Rest / L5**
  - **What shows up**: a location marker that assumes familiarity (Lagrange points).
  - **The gap**: What "L5" refers to (e.g., "a hostel cluster at the Earth–Moon L5 Lagrange point").

---

## Chapter 13 — *The Guardian Appeal*

- **Triad Chamber / separate orbits**
  - **What shows up**: separate station, separate orbit, deliberate independence.
  - **The gap**: Why physical separation matters in a world of remote presence (legitimacy theater? security? independence).

- **AI Guardian as a "presence"**
  - **What shows up**: no body; geometric projection.
  - **The gap**: Whether this is a projection of a remote entity, an AI running locally on the station, or a committee/swarm presented as one voice.

---

## Chapter 14 — *The Low Point*

- **User Veto telemetry vs "resolution window" timing**
  - **What shows up**: countdown and closing windows; "ten days" vs other timings.
  - **The gap**: The governance timeline (operator vote closes → veto window closes → implementation). The plot depends on this and casual readers may get lost.

- **Attention economy as a background force**
  - **What shows up**: "attention is the constraint," but "how" is mostly implied until Ch16.
  - **The gap**: That attention is scarce despite material abundance, and that most people's feeds are AI-curated—so "indifference" isn't apathy, it's infrastructure.

---

## Chapter 15 — *The Decision*

- **"Swarm" as Kenji's personal toolchain**
  - **What shows up**: Kenji has a swarm of agents that brainstorm adversarially.
  - **The gap**: Whether this is normal personal augmentation (everyone has a swarm) or Kenji's special expertise.

- **Jordan living on Mercury (and why that's normal)**
  - **What shows up**: "lived on Mercury," matter-of-fact.
  - **The gap**: That off-Earth living is normal (habitats, life support, radiation shielding, etc.).

---

## Chapter 16 — *The Signal*

- **Light-speed delay as an active constraint**
  - **What shows up**: enumeration coordination slowed by minutes of light delay.
  - **The gap**: That the solar system is *big* and coordination is delay-bound. This feels like a sudden physics lecture without earlier setup.

- **Smart contracts / "cryptographically locked"**
  - **What shows up**: contract is irreversible; executes automatically; proof published.
  - **The gap**: What a smart contract is in this world (a self-executing legal/technical commitment), and why it's trusted more than institutions.

- **"Open chain"**
  - **What shows up**: open chain dashboard; AI news agents monitor it; permanent record.
  - **The gap**: What the "open chain" is (an auditable public information layer with open algorithms, contrasted with proprietary feeds).

- **Agalmic Commons Trust**
  - **What shows up**: infrastructure transfers to a trust funding universal basic services.
  - **The gap**: What a "trust" means here (public-benefit institution) and how the dividend/UBS works in daily life.

---

## Chapter 17 — *Interlude*

- **What it means for the Executive that models were "probability zero"**
  - **What shows up**: swarm modeling predicted no such curve.
  - **The gap**: How governance is usually modeled/managed, so "probability zero" lands as an institutional shock rather than just a dramatic line.

---

## Chapter 18 — *The Climb*

- **The User Veto as a real, binding mechanism**
  - **What shows up**: threshold reached; proposal blocked; window still open; then contract executes at closure.
  - **The gap**: What "blocked" means operationally (proposal nullified? implementation halted?), and why the window stays open after threshold is reached.

---

## Chapter 19 — *The New Project*

- **"Comfort dampeners"**
  - **What shows up**: Elena "dials up her comfort dampeners."
  - **The gap**: What comfort dampeners are (neural modulation? medication? mesh feature?) and whether they're common.

- **Operator access revocation after trust transfer**
  - **What shows up**: Mira can't adjust her resort anymore; she's "a guest."
  - **The gap**: That ownership/control is access-controlled. Without earlier setup, this emotional beat requires readers to reverse-engineer how "operator permissions" work.
