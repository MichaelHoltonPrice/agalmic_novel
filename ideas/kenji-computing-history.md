# Kenji as Computing History Expert

**Source:** Author idea

## Concept

Change Kenji's background so that he is an expert on the **history of computing and virtual worlds**. This becomes the intellectual foundation for his sanctuaries.

## Implications

- His sanctuaries would draw on historical virtual environments, game worlds, early metaverse experiments, etc.
- Adds a layer of nostalgic/archaeological depth to his work
- Could create interesting contrast with Elena's more forward-looking approach
- May require updates to dialogue and backstory references in existing chapters

## Open Questions

- What specific historical eras or systems does he focus on?
- Does this change his relationship with the Gardeners or the swarm?
- Which chapters would need revision?
