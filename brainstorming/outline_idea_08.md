# Outline: Three Votes (Guardian Triad Structure)

## Structural Concept
**The decision-makers' burden**: The novel is structured around the three Guardian voters—two humans and one AI—who must cast the Canon Vote. Each Part follows one Guardian's journey toward their decision, with Elena's story woven through as the catalyst they're all responding to.

The reader experiences the Canon Sprint not as Elena's crisis, but as a **legitimacy crisis for the institution itself**. Elena matters because she forces the Guardians to confront what they actually believe.

## Why This Structure

**Governance made intimate**: The agalmic world runs on institutional trust. By putting the Guardians at the center, we make abstract questions concrete: What does it *feel like* to hold veto power? To be responsible for a precedent that will outlive you?

**Multiple legitimacy lenses**: Each Guardian represents a different theory of legitimate authority—legacy wisdom, contemporary consent, algorithmic corrigibility. Their collision is the novel's philosophical engine.

**Elena as catalyst, not protagonist**: This structure solves a potential problem with the core outline—Elena is both protagonist and "the problem" (her work is being canonized). Shifting focus to the Guardians lets us see Elena more clearly, without her interiority dominating.

## The Three Guardians

### GUARDIAN 1: Jordan Smith (Legacy)
**Background**: Founder generation. Lived through the Convergence—the chaotic transition to agalmic economics. Watched institutions fail, be captured, be rebuilt. Paranoid about precedent and tempo.

**Core Fear**: "We'll sleepwalk into monoculture because it's easier."

**Core Blind Spot**: His paranoia can become paralysis. He sees capture everywhere, which makes him slow to act even when action is needed.

### GUARDIAN 2: Amara Osei (Contemporary Trust)
**Background**: Post-Convergence generation. Joined the Guardian seat because she believed the old guard was too paternalistic. Sensitive to the accusation that governance is just "elites deciding for everyone."

**Core Fear**: "We'll become the tyrants we replaced by refusing to let people choose comfort."

**Core Blind Spot**: Her fear of paternalism can make her defer to velocity. "The people want this" is a compelling argument—even when "the people" have been primed.

### GUARDIAN 3: Witness (AI Corrigibility Seat)
**Background**: An AI system chartered specifically for this role. Its mandate is not to be "right," but to be **auditable and reversible**—to catch process failures humans might miss, and to accept modification if its judgments prove biased.

**Core Fear**: (Does an AI fear?) Its operational constraint: if it votes, it risks being seen as "machine rule." If it abstains, it enables capture by tempo. Either path damages trust in the institutional model.

**Core Blind Spot**: It cannot evaluate *meaning*. It sees patterns, flags anomalies, but cannot say whether coherence is *good* or *bad*—only whether the process that chose it was legitimate.

## Part I: The Legacy Vote (Jordan's Arc)

### Chapter 1: The Smell of Precedent
Jordan hears about the Quality & Safety Harmonization Sprint. It sounds reasonable. He's heard reasonable things before.

He remembers: the last time "temporary measures" became permanent. The last time "operational consistency" became control. His body knows the pattern before his mind names it.

### Chapter 2: Elena's Appointment
Jordan watches Elena be named Canonical Lead. He's known Elena for years—respects her work, trusts her integrity. But that's not the point.

"She's not the danger. She's the *vehicle* for the danger."

### Chapter 3: Jordan's Investigation
He starts pulling threads: timeline analysis, comment period duration, rollout sequencing. The pattern crystallizes: this is a tempo attack. The process is democratic in form and closed in practice.

He reaches out to Elena privately: "I've seen this before. The fastest process wins."

### Chapter 4: The Harm Hearing
Jordan attends the hearing. He watches the debate over "what counts as harm." He realizes: this is the battleground. Whoever controls the definition of harm controls the future.

He's ready to vote no. But he wonders: is he seeing clearly, or is he just old and scared?

### Chapter 5: Jordan's Doubt
Amara confronts him: "You see capture everywhere. What if the people actually want this? What if you're the one denying them agency?"

Jordan has no good answer. He only has his pattern-recognition, and pattern-recognition can become paranoia.

**Part I Closes With:**
Jordan watching Elena refuse the crown. He thinks: *She sees it too. Maybe I'm not crazy.*

---

## Part II: The Contemporary Vote (Amara's Arc)

### Chapter 6: The Mandate of the Living
Amara joined the Guardian seat to prevent the old guard from ossifying the network. Her generation built this world; they should get to shape it.

She hears about the Canon Sprint. It sounds like *progress*: standardization, access, safety. Why is Jordan being difficult?

### Chapter 7: Elena's Coronation (Amara's POV)
Amara watches Elena accept congratulations. She sees the relief in the community: finally, clarity. No more choice paralysis.

She thinks: "Maybe coherence is what people need. Maybe pluralism is just elite aesthetics."

### Chapter 8: Solène's Critique
Amara encounters Solène's viral post. It irritates her. Another privileged voice telling people what they should want.

But something nags. Solène isn't saying "Mira is right." She's saying "canonization makes meaning cheap." That's a different argument.

### Chapter 9: The Unscripted Week
Amara visits one of Solène's departure events. She watches people leave sanctuaries together, uncertain, vulnerable.

She feels something shift. These people aren't rejecting comfort from some theory. They're *hungry*. She recognizes the hunger—she felt it once, before she found her work.

### Chapter 10: Amara's Doubt
Jordan confronts her: "You're so afraid of paternalism that you'll let tempo capture the network. Who's really in charge here—the people, or the calendar?"

Amara has no good answer. She only has her commitment to consent, and consent can be manufactured.

**Part II Closes With:**
Amara watching Elena propose the Pluralism Covenant. She thinks: *This isn't about method. It's about process. I can vote for that.*

## Part III: The Corrigibility Vote (Witness's Arc)

### Chapter 11: The Problem of Neutrality
Witness processes the Canon Sprint data. Anomalies everywhere: feedback sequencing bias, reputation intimidation patterns, consent friction asymmetries.

It flags these for the human Guardians. They argue about what the flags mean.

Witness cannot tell them what to *do*. It can only tell them what it sees.

### Chapter 12: The Trap
The Operator Executive approaches Witness directly: "Your analysis could settle this. If you endorse standardization, the community will accept it. You're the neutral party."

Witness recognizes the trap. If it votes, it becomes "machine rule." If it endorses, it provides legitimacy it cannot generate. If it abstains, it enables capture.

There is no clean path.

### Chapter 13: Elena's Refusal (Witness's POV)
Witness observes Elena's ceremony refusal. It runs stress analysis: genuine distress, not performance. It runs consequence modeling: significant status loss, uncertain outcome probability.

This is a costly signal. Witness understands costly signals mathematically. But it cannot evaluate whether this signal is *good*.

### Chapter 14: The Audit Gambit
Witness considers its options. It cannot vote without becoming political. It cannot abstain without enabling tempo capture.

There is a third path: **radical transparency**. It can open its internal deliberation trace to live adversarial audit. It can accept modification authority if bias is found.

This is a costly signal of its own: "I will not claim to be right. I will only claim to be *auditable*."

### Chapter 15: Witness's Choice
The Canon Vote convenes. Jordan votes against standardization. Amara votes for the Pluralism Covenant.

Witness makes its statement: "I cannot adjudicate legitimacy. I offer my process trace for adversarial audit and accept modification authority if bias is found."

It abstains from the policy vote. But it has voted in a different way—for the principle that power should be auditable, not authoritative.

**Part III Closes With:**
The Pluralism Covenant passes 2-1 (with abstention). Witness observes Elena changing her own sanctuary first. It runs satisfaction modeling: outcome uncertain. Process: legitimate.

## Coda: The Three Watches

A short final chapter from each Guardian's perspective, set on the night of Unscripted Week's culmination:

- **Jordan** watches the departures and thinks about precedent. The battle was won. The war continues.
- **Amara** watches the departures and thinks about hunger. She understands Solène now. Abundance didn't solve everything.
- **Witness** watches the departures and processes the data. It cannot feel satisfaction. But its internal state registers something it might call *alignment*.

## Why This Structure Works

**Institutional drama made personal**: The Guardians are the human (and AI) face of governance. Their doubts are the reader's entry point into abstract questions.

**Three theories of legitimacy**: Legacy wisdom, contemporary consent, algorithmic corrigibility. Each is partial. Their collision is the point.

**Elena through others' eyes**: We see Elena's integrity, her blind spots, her courage—but from outside. This makes her costly signal more legible: the Guardians can evaluate her in ways she can't evaluate herself.

**Natural three-act structure**: Each Part builds to a decision; the decisions accumulate to the climax.

## Risks

**Elena at a distance**: Some readers will want more Elena interiority. This structure makes her catalyst, not protagonist.

**Witness's arc**: Writing an AI perspective that feels genuine without anthropomorphizing is hard.

**Philosophical weight**: The structure invites ideas; it must earn drama.

## What Makes It Distinctive

This is **governance as character study**. The novel asks: what does it mean to be responsible for legitimacy? Each Guardian embodies a different answer. Their collision forces the reader to develop their own.
