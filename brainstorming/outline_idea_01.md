# Outline: The Hunger First (Solène Opens)

## Structural Concept
**Wilson-style intimacy**: Start with the *feeling* of post-scarcity malaise before revealing its institutional dimensions. The reader experiences sanctuary culture through Solène's hunger, making the Canon Sprint feel like the systemization of a problem we've already lived.

## Opening Gambit
**Part I: The Search (Solène's Journey)**

We open with Solène moving through sanctuaries like a ghost, trying to feel something that won't arrive. Not tourism—*need*. She's looking for stakes that abundance can't provide.

### Chapter 1: American Tapestry
Solène visits Elena's sanctuary. It's beautiful, emotionally coherent, moving. She experiences a curated version of American civil rights struggle, feels profound connection... and then walks out feeling *cheated*. The meaning was too easy. She didn't earn it.

We see Elena only from outside: a skilled architect, warm with visitors, proud of her work. Solène doesn't hate her. She envies her certainty.

### Chapter 2: Lapita Horizons  
Solène tries Mira's sanctuary. It's rigorous, uncertain, historically accurate. She experiences reconstructed Lapita navigation—genuinely challenging, often frustrating, full of gaps where the evidence runs out. She feels *respect* for it... but leaves just as hungry. Authenticity isn't enough either.

She begins to articulate the problem: sanctuaries let you *taste* meaning without *risking* anything.

### Chapter 3: The Pattern
Solène talks with her AI companion (maybe a different one, or Echo if we want to establish that relationship early). She's trying to understand: is it *her*, or is it the system? The AI gently suggests that abundance has created a new kind of poverty—poverty of consequence.

She decides: she needs to force a confrontation with the culture itself.

## Transition: The Announcement

### Chapter 4: The News
Solène learns that the sanctuary network is about to declare a "standard model." Elena's approach will become the default. Mira's approach is being quietly marginalized as "risky" and "exclusionary."

Solène realizes: they're about to make the *comfortable* version mandatory. The thing that already felt too easy is about to become policy.

This is when we first meet Elena as a character with interiority—through Solène's eyes, watching Elena receive congratulations that taste like ash.

## Part II: The Canon Sprint (Elena's Trap)

Now we shift primarily to Elena's POV, but Solène remains a constant presence.

### Chapter 5-8: Elena's Institutional Crisis
The procedural thriller unfolds: Mira's confrontation, Echo detecting manipulation, the Operator Executive's tempo control. But now every scene is shadowed by Solène's question: *Why are you defending meaning-as-product?*

Solène doesn't just critique the process—she forces Elena to confront whether her work, however beautiful, is a refuge or a refuge-as-avoidance.

### Chapter 9: Solène Goes Public
When Solène publishes her viral critique, Elena recognizes her—the restless visitor from weeks ago. The speech isn't abstract theory; it's *testimony*. She names what Elena's been afraid to face.

## Part III: Costly Signals (Joint Action)

### Chapter 10-14: The Alliance
Elena and Solène's relationship becomes central. They don't agree—Solène still thinks sanctuaries can be tranquilizers—but they share a goal: prevent monoculture, force pluralism, make comfort expensive enough that it can't pretend to be neutral.

Solène organizes Unscripted Week. Elena proposes the Pluralism Covenant. Mira provides the institutional rigor. Together they build a costly signal too large to ignore.

### Chapter 15-17: The Canon Vote & Resolution
The climax plays out as before, but now we've earned the procedural stakes because we felt the human stakes first.

## Why This Structure Works

**Emotional scaffolding**: We *experience* the problem (sanctuary-as-tranquilizer) before we analyze it (institutional capture).

**Character introduction through action**: We meet Elena by watching Solène watch her—we see her skill and her blindness simultaneously.

**The Wilson parallel**: Like Tyler observing Jason's transformation in *Spin*, Solène observes Elena being crowned and trapped by her own success.

**Rising scope**: Personal hunger → cultural pattern → institutional crisis → systemic solution.

**Earned complexity**: By the time we're in procedural thriller territory, we understand *why* the stakes matter—not just "governance is important," but "this is about what it means to be human in abundance."

## Risks

**Delayed protagonist agency**: Elena doesn't take center stage until Part II (~Chapter 5).

**Solène's interiority**: She'd need to be more than a cipher—we'd need her backstory, her vulnerabilities, her own blind spots.

**Reader patience**: Some readers want the thriller immediately; this structure asks them to trust the slow build.

## What Makes It Compelling

This structure makes the novel feel like **anthropological SF**: we're studying a culture (post-scarcity sanctuary life) before we watch it change. The Canon Sprint becomes *diagnosis becoming crisis*—Solène sees the disease, Elena has the institutional position to treat it, together they force the cure.

And emotionally: we watch two kinds of hunger collide. Solène's hunger for stakes, Elena's hunger for meaning-making. Neither is wrong. The resolution requires both.
