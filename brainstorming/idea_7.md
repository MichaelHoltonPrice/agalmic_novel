# Idea 7: The Guardian's Dilemma

## Concept
This story explores the institutional tension of the "Three-Entity Guardianship" and the "Guardian Veto" mentioned in `PREMISE.md`. It focuses on the conflict between democratic will and the long-term preservation of the agalmic mission.

## The Hook
A popular democratic proposal seeks to decommission a "legacy" server farm—one of the few remaining physical sites of the Great Convergence—to make room for a new, high-demand "Infinite Gardens" sanctuary. The community is overwhelmingly in favor, but the Guardian Foundation suspects the server farm contains encrypted, non-reproducible data that is essential to the "Reversion to the Commons" protocol.

## Core Tension
- **Democratic Agency vs. Institutional Integrity**: If 95% of the community wants the gardens, does the Guardian have the moral right to use the "nuclear option" (the Veto) to save a dusty warehouse of old hardware?
- **Material Scarcity in an Abundant World**: While digital goods are free, physical space in prime locations (near the original Convergence hubs) remains finite and rivalrous.
- **The Cost of the Veto**: Using the Veto is a "costly signal." It damages the Guardian's reputation and trust with the community. Is the secret data worth the social collapse of the institution?

## Characters
- **Soren**: A young Guardian who recently inherited the "Golden Share." He is a "Convergence Baby" who values the history his generation is eager to pave over.
- **Kael**: The charismatic leader of the "Infinite Gardens" proposal. He believes the past should serve the living and that the Guardian's "veto power" is a vestigial organ of a paranoid era.
- **Echo (or similar AI)**: Providing the technical context that the data *might* be essential, but even the AI isn't 100% sure due to the "weirdness" of early Convergence coding.

## Narrative Arc
1. **The Vote**: The proposal for the Gardens passes with record support.
2. **The Discovery**: Soren finds evidence that the server farm isn't just a relic; it's a "dead man's switch" for the agalmic protocols.
3. **The Standoff**: Kael and the community begin the "ceremonial dismantling" of the site. Soren must decide whether to trigger the Veto.
4. **The Resolution**: Soren uses the Veto, triggering a massive social backlash. The story ends not with a "victory," but with the difficult work of rebuilding trust and explaining why some "gifts" of the past must be kept, even if they are heavy.

## Themes
- The burden of legacy.
- The fragility of agalmic institutions.
- The difference between "what we want" and "what we need to survive."
