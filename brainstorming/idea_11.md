# Idea 11: The Inheritance War

## Core Concept

Jordan Smith's old company, Agalmic Studios, faces an existential crisis: a coalition of users wants to trigger the "Reversion to the Commons" clause—deliberately killing the institution so its assets become public domain.

This isn't sabotage. It's a sincere philosophical position: the coalition believes that *all* institutions eventually calcify, and that planned institutional death is better than slow decay. They want to prove that the agalmic model's greatest feature—the guarantee that nothing is captured forever—can work as intended.

## The Narrative Hook

Elena is drawn into the conflict because the proposed reversion would include Agalmic Studios' vast archive of pre-Convergence cultural materials—materials that inform sanctuary design across the network. If the archive becomes public domain without institutional stewardship, it might become accessible but unusable: raw data without the curatorial layer that makes it meaningful.

Jordan finds himself on the opposite side from people he respects. He built Agalmic Studios to serve the public good. Now some of the public wants to kill his life's work—and they're using the very mechanisms he designed.

## Central Tension

The agalmic model was built on the premise that reversion to the commons is *good*—a feature, not a bug. But in practice, triggering it feels like destruction. The story forces characters to confront whether their institutional attachments are principled or sentimental.

The deeper question: Can institutions ever be "finished"? Is there a moment when a successful institution should step aside, or does success create obligations that justify permanence?

## Character Dynamics

**Jordan's Internal Conflict**: He designed the reversion clause. He believed in it theoretically. Now that it might actually happen, he discovers that theory and practice feel very different. His journey is about distinguishing between legitimate concerns (stewardship, continuity) and ego attachment (this is *my* legacy).

**Elena's Caught-in-the-Middle Position**: She values the archive but isn't sentimentally attached to the institution. Her boundary archaeologist perspective lets her see both sides: institutions are human creations with lifespans, *and* some things are genuinely better with ongoing care.

**Mira's Clarity**: Mira surprises everyone by supporting the reversion coalition—not because she wants the archive destroyed, but because she believes authentic reconstruction requires access to primary sources without institutional gatekeeping. Her Lapita work has sometimes been frustrated by proprietary archives. She sees an opportunity.

**Echo's Analysis**: Echo runs simulations of both outcomes: what happens to the archive with reversion vs. without. The simulations are inconclusive—too many variables, too much path dependence. Echo's honesty about uncertainty frustrates everyone who wants a clear answer.

## Thematic Depth

**The Three-Entity Model Under Stress**: The Guardian Foundation must decide whether to exercise its veto. But the clause was designed to allow reversion under certain conditions—conditions that may now be met. Using the veto could undermine the model's legitimacy; not using it might destroy something valuable.

**Democratic Will vs. Minority Protection**: The coalition has enough votes to trigger reversion under the dual-layer voting system. But is this what democracy is *for*? The story explores whether democratic processes can legitimately destroy the institutions they govern.

**The Anthropological Long View**: Throughout human history, institutions have risen and fallen. The archive itself documents hundreds of dead institutions. Why should Agalmic Studios be exempt from the pattern it catalogs?

## Narrative Structure

The story unfolds over a formal deliberation period—the months between the coalition's proposal and the final vote. Characters make their cases, form alliances, shift positions. The structure mirrors an extended legal proceeding, but the "courtroom" is the democratic forum.

Interludes show Jordan visiting sanctuaries that use Agalmic Studios materials—seeing his life's work embodied in experiences he never imagined. These visits complicate his feelings without resolving them.

The climax is the vote itself. But the real resolution comes afterward, when characters must live with the outcome and discover that neither victory nor defeat is what they expected.

## The Agalmic Angle

This story tests the agalmic model's self-description. The model claims to be anti-fragile—designed to release value even when institutions fail. But does it work? The characters become case studies in whether institutional death can be generative rather than destructive.

## Emotional Core

The story is about letting go—of institutions, of legacy, of the need to control outcomes beyond one's lifespan. Jordan's arc is learning that his work can survive him, even if his institution doesn't. Elena's arc is learning that some things are worth fighting for even when the fight might be futile.

The ending leaves Agalmic Studios' fate uncertain in the details but certain in the larger picture: whatever happens, the agalmic world will continue, and the characters will find new ways to matter within it.
