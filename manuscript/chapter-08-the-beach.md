# Chapter 8: The Beach

## Elena

---

The transit pod's deceleration was gentle, the kind that fooled you into thinking you'd been stationary all along. Elena watched the viewport as Mira's habitat resolved itself—another rotating cylinder like her own, but as it filled the window, greens and blues washed over her instead of rustic hues. A different world entirely.

She stepped out into humidity and noted, professionally, how Mira had calibrated it—the salt-to-organic ratio in the air, the way the moisture settled without becoming oppressive. Good work. Different from her own environmental algorithms, but equally deliberate. Elena's prairie pulled moisture out; Mira's islands wrapped you in it. Both choices, both defensible.

"Elena?"

The voice startled her. She turned to see Kenji emerging from the path that led toward the visitor areas. He was dressed for the beach—loose linen shirt unbuttoned over swim trunks, bare feet leaving prints in the soft ground, a towel slung over one shoulder. Kenji Sato, whose Mesoamerican sanctuaries—Maya, Aztec, Olmec, and others—were among the most respected in the network, was clearly enjoying Mira's hospitality.

"Elena!" His face lit up. He pulled her into a hug before she could respond. "I didn't know you were coming."

"Kenji." She found herself smiling despite everything. His warmth was infectious. "What are you doing here?"

"Same as you, probably." He laughed—the same easy laugh that had always made methodological arguments feel more like conversations than battles. "I reached out to Mira after I saw the proposal. Turns out I wasn't the only one."

"How many?"

"I'm not sure. People have been arriving since yesterday. Some Mira contacted, some just showed up." He tilted his head, considering her. "You look like you need a drink. Come on—I know a place."

Like most boundary archaeologists, Mira had a range of themed sanctuaries within her habitat. Kenji led Elena past the Lapita village reconstructions, past taro fields and mangrove channels, until the environment shifted abruptly. The path opened onto a crescent of white sand, and Elena stopped.

A 1980s resort sprawled before her. Thatched-roof bungalows with ceiling fans turning lazily. Lounge chairs with bright striped cushions. A poolside bar where a bartender—AI-driven, but dressed in a Hawaiian shirt with period-appropriate hair—was already mixing something pink. From hidden speakers, synth-heavy pop drifted across the beach: Duran Duran, or something close.

"Mira made this?" Elena asked.

"Last year. She calls it 'The Tahitian Dream, 1987.' Apparently it was a real place—she found the architectural plans in some archive." Kenji was already walking toward the bar. "It's her guilty pleasure. Still faithful reconstruction, but the 1980s aren't exactly a challenge. And it's just... fun."

They settled into lounge chairs with piña coladas—served in actual coconut shells, neon paper umbrellas and all. The drink was cold and sweet and exactly right. Elena kicked off her boots and let her feet sink into warm sand. For a long moment, neither of them spoke.

"I've missed this," Kenji said finally. "Just... sitting with someone who gets it."

Elena nodded. The reconstructed sun was perfect—warm without burning, the light golden and slightly hazy in a way that said *late afternoon, tropical, no obligations*. She could feel her shoulders unknotting for the first time since she'd read the proposal.

"So," she said. "The manifesto—"

Kenji snorted and threw a handful of sand at her. It scattered across her legs, warm and fine-grained. Some got in her drink. She took a sip anyway.

"Hey!" she yelled, a little belated.

"There's time for that later." He signaled the bartender for another round. "Right now, you're going to tell me how the Morrison arc turned out. Last I heard, you were agonizing over whether the daughter's fever should break twice or three times."

Elena crunched a piece of ice, feeling the faint, mineral grit of the sand between her teeth. "Three times. It was the only way to get the pacing right. But I'm still getting flagged for 'excessive emotional friction' by the automated audits. Apparently, three fevers is a 'cognitive burden.'"

Kenji laughed, a deep sound that competed with the synth-pop. "Audits. They want us to build cathedrals but keep the ceiling height to code. I had a guy last month file a formal grievance because my Aztec ball court didn't have 'adequate seating for spectators with vertigo.' I told him the Aztecs didn't have tiered seating; you stood in the mud and hoped the gods liked you."

"Did you give in?"

"I gave him a physical support—a rough-hewn cedar beam that looked like a construction scaffold. It ruined the sightlines for the entire eastern quadrant, but at least he didn't fall over. He spent the whole match clutching it like a drowning man." Kenji leaned back, his eyes half-closed against the golden light. "But really, Elena. You look tired. Not 'two days in a transit pod' tired. More like 'carrying the weight of a tradition' tired."

"Is it that obvious?"

"To me? Yes. We’ve been comparing benchmarks since the Luna conference. Speaking of—did you hear about Silas? He finally quit the Colonial America project."

Elena sat up, nearly spilling the rest of her gritty piña colada. "Silas? He was the most stubborn guy in the network. What happened?"

"He moved to a 1950s suburbia sim. Says he wanted to work with lawns. 'Low stakes, high fidelity,' that was his quote. I think he just wanted to stop arguing about smallpox blankets and start arguing about the correct shade of lawn-green."

"Traitor," Elena said viciously, though she couldn't help a small, envious smile. "I can't imagine Silas without a flintlock."

"He's happy. Sent me a pic of a reconstructed charcoal grill. He looked... peaceful. It was disturbing."

They lapsed into a comfortable silence, listening to the synthesized waves. The music shifted to something faster, a drum-machine beat that made Kenji tap his bare feet against the footrest. 

"I missed this," he said, and for a second the playfulness dropped away, replaced by the same vulnerability she'd felt when she first saw him. "The talk. The shop. The way we can sit here in a fake 1980s resort and talk about smallpox and ball-games and actually care about the difference."

"It's not a job," Elena said softly, "it's a vocation."

"Maybe." He paused. "Or maybe it's a way of being." He looked over at her, his expression uncharacteristically serious. "Either way, that's why we're all here, Elena. Because they're trying to make it a job. A standardized, predictable, auditable job."

He held her gaze for a moment, then blinked and gestured toward the bar. "But enough of that. Look at that bartender's hair. Is that a mullet? I think Mira gave him a mullet."

Elena followed his gaze and laughed. "It's definitely a mullet. And I think he's wearing actual aviator sunglasses. The commitment is terrifying."

"That's Mira. She can't help herself." Kenji stood up, brushing sand from his shorts. "I'm going to go see if he can make something called a 'Blue Hawaii.' It sounds like it should be illegal. Want one?"

"Only if it comes with another umbrella."

"Two umbrellas," Kenji promised, walking toward the bar with a skip in his step. "Minimum."

He came back with two glasses of a liquid so blue it looked like it should be used for cooling the superconducting magnets in a fusion reactor. Each was garnished with a slice of neon-red cherry, a wedge of pineapple, and three paper umbrellas of varying heights.

"To questionable aesthetic choices," Kenji said, handing her one.

Elena took a sip. It tasted like pineapple, coconut, and a type of sugar that had probably been banned in the 21st century. "It's... remarkably blue."

"It matches the horizon," Kenji said, gesturing to where the sky was deepening into a perfect, saturated indigo. "Mira's very thorough with her saturation levels. Even the containment feels different here."

Elena looked up at the high, artificial sky. "How does she keep it all separate? I was thinking about the Lapita site. The death adders. The venomous reef-life. You’d think the biosecurity would be a nightmare with the resort zones so close."

"It's a redundant stack," Kenji said, finishing a cherry. "Structural barriers first—deep-water trenches and ridge-lines that look like geography but act as hard containment. Then she layers in micro-climate thresholds. The reptiles hit a wall of dry, cool air and turn back by instinct. And for the insects, there’s acoustic geofencing and biosecurity swarms—thousands of micro-drones disguised as dragonflies and beetles, nudging the biology back into its proper era. It's sheer engineering audacity, keeping the 'hard' history from eating the 'guilty pleasures.'"

"It's beautiful," Elena said, watching the indigo deepen. "But it feels like a lot of work to keep the bad things out of the fun things."

"That's the job, Elena. Or the vocation. Whatever we're calling it today."

They sat in the deepening twilight, the music shifting to a slower, more soulful beat—something about a diamond life. They talked about the people they missed, the ones who had moved on to building virtual sanctuaries or lived in the outer solar system and couldn't so easily visit. They talked about the time they'd tried to collaborate on a 'Silk Road meets American West' project that had collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions.

"Yusuf still says the camels were the problem," Kenji said, chuckling. "But we both know it was the buffalo."

"The buffalo were magnificent," Elena defended. "They just didn't like the elevation."

"They tried to eat the caravansarai, Elena."

"A minor technical hurdle."

By the time the sun had fully set—replaced by a starfield that was too bright and too crowded for the late twentieth century, but which Mira had left in anyway—Elena felt a strange, fragile peace. The proposal still haunted the edges of her thoughts, but here, with the neon-blue syrup and the synth-pop and one of her oldest friends, the world felt large again. It was no longer just a string of governance notifications and audit logs.

Eventually, they wandered back to the guest quarters. As they parted, Kenji said, "Tomorrow it's the Tiare Club. Apparently Yusuf found the gin slings."

When she got back to her room, she set her glasses on the nightstand and let the silence settle. 

"Echo," she said. "Remind me to needle Mira about the starfield. All these years, and it's the only time I've seen her choose the view over the truth."
