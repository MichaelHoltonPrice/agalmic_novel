# Chapter 1: The Sanctuary

## Elena

---

The dust tasted wrong.

Elena knelt in the reconstructed wagon rut, letting the ochre soil sift through her fingers. She had spent three weeks calibrating the sensory palette for this section of American Tapestry—the mineral tang of alkaline flats, the cedar-smoke that clung to everything after the evening fires, the particular grit that worked its way into boot seams and never quite came out. But something in the blend was off. Too clean, maybe. Too much like a memory of dust rather than the thing itself.

"Echo," she said, not looking up. "The particulate mix in this zone. What's the iron oxide ratio?"

The voice came through her earbuds, warm and unhurried, spatially positioned so it seemed to originate from just over her left shoulder—an old habit they'd developed together. "Currently 4.2 percent by mass. Historical samples from the Platte River corridor suggest a range of 3.8 to 6.1 percent, depending on seasonal flooding and wind patterns."

"Push it to 5.5. And add... something. A bitterness."

"Bitterness is not a standard particulate property."

"I know." Elena stood, brushing her hands against her trousers—wool-blend, 1870s pattern, because she always dressed the part when she was working. It helped her think. The glasses were the one anachronism she allowed herself: slim titanium frames, almost invisible, connecting her to Echo and the habitat's systems while leaving her mind her own. Most people her age had cortical mesh, thoughts and data seamlessly blended. Elena preferred the separation. When she took these off, she was alone with herself. That mattered.

"But the journals all mention it," she continued. "The emigrants wrote about how the dust *tasted* bitter, how it made them think of failure. That's not chemistry. That's association."

A pause. With Echo, pauses were choices, not processing delays. "You want me to cross-reference olfactory triggers associated with negative emotional valence and identify compounds that might produce a similar subjective impression?"

"I want you to help me make this real."

"That's what I'm doing."

Elena smiled despite herself. Seventeen years they'd worked together—since she was eleven and Echo was barely a year old, both of them figuring out what they were for. The AI had grown alongside her, its personality shaped by their collaboration the way rivers shaped canyons: slowly, inexorably, leaving something beautiful in the wake.

She walked the length of the wagon rut, her boots leaving prints in the calibrated dust. Around her, the Nebraska prairie stretched to a horizon that curved gently upward at the edges—thirty kilometers of reconstructed landscape wrapped around the interior of her cylinder, the grasses rippling in a wind that followed algorithms she'd tuned by hand. The sky was enormous and indifferent, the particular blue of August on the Great Plains projected onto the habitat's central axis, and in the distance a smudge of smoke marked where another family's wagon had thrown a wheel and caught fire while they tried to repair it. A small tragedy. One of thousands.

"The Delgado family arrives in forty minutes," Echo said. "Their intake profile suggests particular interest in the California gold rush narrative, but also flagged sensitivities around child mortality."

"Which branch did they choose?"

"They requested the Donner Party experience initially, then revised to the less-immersive 1849 emigrant trail."

Elena nodded. The revision was common. People thought they wanted the extremity, the horror, the full weight of historical suffering—and then they got close enough to feel its shadow and flinched. She didn't judge them for it. The flinching was part of the experience, too. Learning what you could bear was information.

"Show me their emotional baseline again."

Data bloomed across her glasses—translucent overlays that floated at the edges of her vision without obscuring the prairie. Four heartbeats rendered as gentle waves, four breathing patterns, four cortisol signatures. The Delgados were a mixed-generation family—two parents in their fifties who remembered the world before the Convergence, two children born after, now in their early twenties. They'd made the journey from Earth, two days of transit to reach this cylinder, and their intake forms suggested they'd been planning the trip for months. The parents' baselines ran higher, their systems primed for stress even in rest. They had lived through genuine scarcity. Their bodies hadn't forgotten.

The children were different. Calm to the point of flatness. They had never been hungry without choosing it, never been cold without a warming system waiting, never faced a problem that abundance couldn't dissolve. They could have accessed American Tapestry virtually—millions did, the software streamed free to anyone with cortical mesh—but they'd chosen to come here in person. To walk this ground with their actual feet, breathe this manufactured air with their actual lungs. Elena suspected they'd made that choice because the flatness had started to feel like a kind of poverty, and they were hoping physical presence might cost them something virtual access couldn't.

She understood. She had been one of those children once.

"Cross-fade the fire simulation as they approach," she said. "Don't extinguish it—let it gutter. I want them to see the aftermath, not the crisis. And have the Morrisons available as NPCs if they want to talk to other emigrants, but make sure Michael Morrison mentions his daughter's fever only if they ask."

"The Morrison daughter dies on day three of their journey."

"I know. But they shouldn't learn that unless they're ready to hold it."

The data on her glasses flickered once, acknowledging. Echo never questioned her instincts about pacing—not anymore. In the early years, they had argued constantly about the ethics of staged suffering, the line between empathy and voyeurism, the ways that curated pain could become another form of consumption. Those arguments had been essential. They had made both of them sharper.

Now they trusted each other. Not blindly—never blindly—but the way you trusted a climbing partner who had caught your falls.

Elena walked to the overlook she had built on a low rise, a place where visitors could stand and see the trail stretching west—or what passed for west in a rotating cylinder where the sun was a lighting rig and cardinal directions were artistic choices. The geography was composite—bits of Nebraska, Wyoming, Nevada compressed into a single vista that curved subtly upward if you knew where to look—but the emotional logic was true. This was where emigrants had stopped and looked at the distance still to travel and wondered if they would make it. Some of them hadn't. Their bones were scattered across a thousand miles, marked by wooden crosses that the weather had long since erased.

She sat on a sandstone outcrop and let the wind move over her face. It smelled like sage and smoke and something she couldn't name, a green-gold scent that might have been optimism or might have been denial. She had spent six years building this place, layering detail onto detail until it felt less like a simulation and more like a scar—a wound in time that visitors could touch and, touching, understand something about themselves.

That was the theory, anyway. In practice, she never knew what people took away. The sanctuary gave them raw material; they built their own meanings.

"The Delgados arrive in thirty-five minutes," Echo said, a gentle reminder.

"I know." Elena didn't move. "I just need a few minutes here."

Echo understood. It had learned when to give her silence.

She let her gaze follow the trail west—or what her sanctuary called west, since cardinal directions in a rotating cylinder were really just aesthetic choices. The trail curved up and away, disappearing into the haze where her thirty-kilometer world met the limits of its own horizon.

The emigrants had believed in a destination—California, Oregon, a place where the soil was richer and the future less cruel. Some of them had made it. Most had simply traded one kind of hardship for another. But they had *moved*. They had chosen the uncertainty of motion over the certainty of staying.

Elena wondered sometimes what they would think of her world. A place where no one had to move unless they wanted to, where every need was met before it became urgent, where the future was always less cruel than the past. Would they see it as victory? Or would they see what she sometimes saw: people so safe they'd forgotten what they were capable of bearing?

She took off her glasses and set them beside her on the stone. The prairie blurred slightly—her natural vision was good but not quite perfect—and the data overlays vanished. Just rock and grass and wind. Just her thoughts, unaugmented, moving at the speed of neurons instead of networks.

She had been eleven when she'd first understood what a sanctuary could be.

Her father had taken her to one of the early ones—not a carefully reconstructed historical space like she built now, but something rawer. A piece of Earth's deep past, Pleistocene rewilding, mammoths and saber-cats moving through grasslands that had been gone for twelve thousand years. She'd watched a mammoth family cross a river, the calves staying close to their mothers, the adults testing each step before committing their weight. And she'd felt something bloom inside her chest—pure wonder, the kind that made her breath catch and her eyes sting.

*This was real.* Not the original real, but real enough. Something that had been gone for twelve thousand years was here, now, breathing and moving and *alive*. Someone had cared enough to bring it back.

Later, much later, she would understand the complications—that these were echoes, not originals, that resurrection was always partial, that loss could never be fully undone. But at eleven, standing by that river, she'd felt only awe. And the conviction, fierce and immediate: *I want to do this. I want to make this my life's work.*

That was when she'd understood what she wanted to spend her life doing.

Not preservation—preservation implied saving something that still existed. This was something else. Reconstruction. Resurrection. Making echoes loud enough that people could hear what the original sound had been like, even if the original sound was gone forever.

American Tapestry wasn't about perfect historical accuracy. Mira could have that conversation—did have that conversation, with anyone who would listen, and Elena loved her for it. But Elena was trying to do something different. She was trying to capture what it had *felt* like to live in a time when your choices mattered because they had weight. When the dust in your mouth tasted bitter because you knew—really knew—that you might not make it to tomorrow.

People in her world didn't know that feeling. They knew its simulation, its echo. They could visit it for a day or a week and then return to the safety of abundance. Was that enough? She didn't know. But it was what she had to offer.

She put her glasses back on. The data overlays bloomed back into existence: wind speed, temperature gradients, the Delgados' current position (twenty-eight minutes out), a reminder that she'd promised to review the sensory calibration for the river crossing scene. The world became annotated again, legible, manageable.

"Echo," she said. "Pull up the Morrison daughter's illness progression. The fever arc."

A timeline appeared, floating in her peripheral vision. The girl—Sarah Morrison, age seven, programmed with memories of a rag doll named Button and a fear of thunderstorms—would begin showing symptoms in six hours. By the third day, she would be too weak to walk. On the fifth day, if the family stayed with the wagon train, she would die. They had the option to turn back, to give up and return to Fort Laramie. Most families chose to press on. The ones who turned back often lost the child anyway, and arrived at the fort too late to join another wagon train that season. There were no good choices. Only different kinds of loss.

"You've softened the timeline twice already," Echo said. Gently. Not judging. Just observing.

"I know."

"The progression is now five days instead of three. The parents will have more time with her before the decision point."

"The Delgados' intake profile flagged sensitivities around child mortality," Elena said. "They revised down from Donner Party to standard emigrant trail. I'm giving them what they asked for—something they can bear."

"You're also changing what happened."

"I'm choosing which version of what happened." Elena opened her eyes. "Dysentery killed children at different rates depending on dozens of factors. I'm picking a slower progression that's still historically attested. That's the work."

"That's always the work," Echo agreed.

She stood, brushing dust from her trousers. These choices never felt clean, but they felt honest. She wasn't pretending to show people exactly what happened. She was showing them a version they could hold.

She stood, brushing dust from her trousers. The prairie stretched around her, beautiful and impossible and hers. Thirty kilometers of reconstructed longing. A place where people came to remember what their bodies used to know, before abundance had made forgetting easy.

"Show me the Delgado emotional baselines one more time," she said. "I want to see where they're starting from."

The data bloomed: four heartbeats, four breathing patterns, four different kinds of anticipation. The parents' baselines were higher—they had known scarcity, and their bodies remembered. The children were flatter, calmer, curious but not *hungry*. Not yet.

Elena wondered which of them would feel it first. The weight of the dust. The impossible distance of the horizon. The way hope and despair could walk side by side down a wagon trail, indistinguishable until you looked back and saw which one's footprints you'd been following.

She started walking toward the entry gate. The wind pushed at her back, carrying the smoke-smell from the guttering fire. Somewhere a hawk cried—her hawk, her recording, her choice of what a prairie should sound like. Every detail in this place was a choice she had made. Every choice was a kind of lie that tried to tell a truth.

But the Delgados were real. Their hunger was real. And for a few days, she would do her best to feed it with echoes.

"Twenty-three minutes," Echo said.

"I'm ready," Elena said. And realized, saying it, that it was true.

This was the work. This was what she had built her life to do. Not perfect. Not innocent. But *hers*, and maybe that was enough.

She walked toward the gate, leaving footprints in the bitter dust, and prepared to welcome four strangers into a history that had almost been forgotten.
