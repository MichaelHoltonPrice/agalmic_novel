# Chapter 14: The Low Point

## Ensemble

---

The call connected across four locations: Mira and Yusuf in transit, their faces lit by the pale glow of their pod's display; Elena at Lapita Horizons, where she'd come after the Executive meeting; Kenji at his Silk Road caravanserai, surrounded by half-finished AI drafts; and Solène at Wanderer's Rest, the hostel cluster near L5 where she'd been staying since her essay went viral.

It was the first time all of them had been in the same conversation.

Solène wasn't sure when she'd become part of "all of them." A month ago, she'd been writing essays about how these people—the pioneers, the artisanal meaning-makers—were half the problem. Now she was on a call where her name appeared alongside theirs like she belonged there. She didn't, quite. But here she was anyway.

"Two to one," Mira said. Her voice was steady, but the exhaustion showed in the set of her shoulders. "The AI dissented. The humans declined to block."

"Their reasoning?" Elena asked.

"Principled. They're weighing operator voice and demonstrated harm against systemic resilience. They think the 71% vote represents genuine democratic legitimacy, and overruling it would look like founder overreach." Mira paused. "I don't agree with them, but I understand the argument."

Kenji let out a long breath. "So the Guardian path is closed."

"Closed." Yusuf's voice was flat. "They suggested the User Veto is the appropriate mechanism if we believe the users have different interests than the operators."

"About that." Elena's face was grim. "Kenji, show them the numbers."

Kenji pulled up a display—a graph that should have been climbing, and wasn't. "This is the User Veto telemetry. We need two-thirds of active end-users—roughly 9.3 million votes—to override the proposal. Right now we're at..." He squinted at the number. "Eleven percent."

Silence.

"Eleven percent," Solène repeated. "That's nothing."

"Actually," Kenji said, "it's unprecedented. No User Veto campaign has ever gotten above four percent. The previous record was 3.8%, on a proposal about sanctuary naming conventions twelve years ago." He gestured at the flat line on the graph. "We've nearly tripled the highest engagement in the history of the mechanism. Solène's essay moved the needle more than anything ever has."

"But the needle is almost impossible to move," Elena said quietly. "We need sixty-seven percent. We're at eleven. The gap is..." She didn't finish.

"The gap is immense," Yusuf said.

Kenji nodded. "The curve isn't climbing anymore. We pushed for a week. Solène's essay went viral—seventeen thousand shares, hundreds of personal stories in response. The attention is real. But the *votes* stopped following."

"Why?" Mira asked.

Elena pulled up another display—a breakdown of the voting data. "Here's the thing. Among users who actually engage with the arguments—who read the proposal, who consider the implications—eighty-three percent vote to veto. Even accounting for selection bias, the pattern holds. When people think about it, they agree with us."

"So the problem isn't persuasion," Mira said slowly.

"No. The problem is attention." Elena gestured at the data. "Eighty-three percent of engaged users. But only fourteen percent of eligible users have engaged at all. The other eighty-six percent haven't seen the arguments. Haven't read the proposal. Haven't thought about it. They're not disagreeing with us—they're not even in the conversation."

"It's the nature of the world," Kenji said. "Attention is everywhere. Fragmented across a million channels, a million experiences, a million things that feel more immediate than governance process. Solène's essay broke through for seventeen thousand people. But there are fourteen million eligible voters. Most of them will never see it. Not because they're hiding from it—because they're just... living their lives."

"And the proposal sounds reasonable on the surface," Kenji added. "'Quality frameworks.' 'Safety standards.' 'Quintessential experience.' Who's against quality? Who's against safety? You have to do some thinking to understand what's at stake."

Solène felt something cold settle in her chest. She'd thought the viral moment meant something. She'd thought being seen was the beginning of change.

"So my essay didn't matter."

"Your essay mattered," Elena said quickly. "It created awareness. It validated people's feelings. It—"

"It didn't move the numbers. Not enough." Solène's voice was flat. "Seventeen thousand shares, and we're at eleven percent."

She watched Elena's face—earnest, sympathetic, trying to make her feel better. This was the woman whose sanctuary had embodied everything Solène had criticized. Beauty without stakes. Craft without cost. And now Elena was reassuring her, welcoming her, treating her like a colleague instead of a critic.

Part of Solène wanted to accept it. Part of her wondered if she was being absorbed.

No one contradicted her at first, but then Kenji said, "Well, but we have to consider the counterfactual. If you hadn't written the essay, we'd be even worse off!"

Mira's face on the display was still, unreadable. "Elena, what about the Executive?"

Elena's expression tightened. "I met with him yesterday. It didn't go well."

"What happened?"

"He was... polite. Sincere. He listened to everything I said. He understood my concerns about the proposal being used to exclude rather than include." She paused. "And then he explained, very calmly, that the proposal followed every rule. That the operators had spoken. That his role was to steward the process, not to override it based on the objections of a minority—even a minority he respected."

"He's not going to help," Yusuf said.

"No. He believes in the proposal. Not because he's captured, but because he genuinely thinks standardization will protect people. He's wrong, but he's sincere." Elena shook her head. "I planted a seed, maybe. But it won't grow in time."

"So let me make sure I understand." Yusuf leaned forward, his voice taking on the careful, methodical tone he used when teaching students about excavation grids. "The operator vote passed with seventy-one percent. The Guardian Triad declined to veto, two to one. The User Veto is at eleven percent with no upward momentum. And the Executive believes in the proposal and won't undercut a process that followed every rule."

"That's correct," Elena said.

"Every institutional path has failed."

The words hung there.

Kenji broke the silence. "We've got... what, ten days until the resolution window closes? After that, the proposal takes effect. Our sanctuaries become non-compliant. We either conform or we're out of the network."

"Fourteen days," Mira said. "But ten before the last practical chance for the veto to trigger."

"Same thing." Kenji's usual lightness was gone. "We don't have time to build momentum. We'd need to go from eleven percent to sixty-seven percent in ten days. That's not a campaign. That's a miracle."

Solène watched the faces on her display—the founders she'd admired from a distance, the pioneers whose work had shaped her understanding of what experience could be. They looked tired. Defeated.

"There has to be something," she said. "Some other path."

Elena shook her head. "We've tried prestige. We've tried arguments. We've tried viral attention. We've tried institutional channels. None of it worked." She paused. "In a world of abundance, being right isn't enough. Being famous isn't enough. Being respected isn't enough. People are comfortable. They're not paying attention to governance because governance doesn't feel urgent. It's just... background process."

"So what do we do?"

The question came from Yusuf, but it could have come from any of them.

Mira was quiet for a long moment. Then: "We need to talk. All of us. In person, when we're back. There may be options we haven't considered. Things we haven't been willing to consider."

"Like what?"

"I don't know yet." Mira's voice was careful, as if she were picking her way through uncertain ground. "But if institutional paths won't work, and attention won't work, and prestige won't work... then we need something else. Something that can cut through the indifference." She paused. "Before our next meeting, do some thinking. Ask an AI agent swarm to do some brainstorming. Talk to your friends, your personal AI—anybody who might have ideas we haven't considered."

The answer wasn't in the room yet. But the tone of the conversation had shifted. The mourning wasn't over—but beneath it, something else was stirring. A question, not an answer. A direction, not a destination.

"When do you arrive?" Elena asked.

"Two days," Mira said. "We'll meet at Lapita. All of us. Figure out if there's anything left to try."

The call ended. Solène sat in the slanting light of Wanderer's Rest, watching the numbers that hadn't moved.

Eleven percent.

She'd thought being seen was victory. She'd thought the viral moment meant something. She'd thought attention was power.

But attention without action was just noise. And noise, even in an agalmic world, was the cheapest thing there was.
