# Chapter 9: The Tiare Club

## Elena

---

The transition from 1987 to 1926 was a sensory palate cleanser. Elena and Kenji moved through the habitat’s transit corridor—a cool, brushed-steel airlock that hummed with the work of environmental seals—and stepped out into a world of "tropical noir."

"The Tiare Club, 1926" was a masterpiece of Art Deco symmetry. White-washed walls, teak-planked verandas, and ceiling fans that turned with the slow, rhythmic pulse of a sleeping giant. From a gramophone on a lacquer side table, a crackling record played early jazz, the trumpet notes sounding thin and lonely against the vast, lush jungle that pressed against the club’s perimeter.

"Now this," Kenji said, smoothing his unbuttoned linen shirt, "is where the serious drinking happens."

The veranda was mostly empty, save for a figure in the corner that seemed to occupy two chairs at once. Yusuf was a mountain of a man—broad-shouldered and ponderous, his presence alone seemed to change the room's center of gravity. He was slumped in a wicker armchair, a gin sling in one hand and a tattered paper book in the other, looking like he was personally mourning the end of the nineteenth century.

"Yusuf!" Kenji called out.

The big man’s head snapped up. For a second, the morose fog around him cleared entirely. To Elena’s surprise, Yusuf didn't just stand; he surged upward with the unexpected agility of a leopard, nearly upending the lacquer table. 

"Elena! Kenji!" His voice was a rich baritone that seemed to vibrate in the floorboards. He swept them both into a crushing, simultaneous embrace that smelled of juniper and old paper. "Look at you! You survived the eighties! I was worried the neon would claim you both."

"We barely made it out of the Blue Hawaiis," Kenji gasped as Yusuf finally released them.

Yusuf laughed—a deep, booming sound that made the gramophone needle skip a beat. "Blue Hawaiis. A crime against chemistry. Sit, sit! I’ve had the waiter—a charming fellow with a mustache that I’m eighty percent sure is sentient—preparing a fresh batch of slings."

"You seem... energetic," Elena said, settling into a chair that smelled faintly of lemon wax.

"It’s the oxygen," Yusuf said, his expression settling back into a comfortable sort of gloom. He sat down, the wicker groaning in protest. "In the 'death zone' reconstructions, I spend half my life wondering if I’m hallucinating from hypoxia. Here, the air is so thick I feel like I could eat it with a spoon. It’s disgusting. I love it."

"Have you seen Mira?" Kenji asked.

Yusuf’s smile didn't reach his eyes this time. He took a long, thoughtful sip of his sling. "No. Our host is 'deep in the zones.' Reported sightings in the 14th-century lagoon, but she’s blocked all the public location logs. She’s letting us accumulate."

"Accumulate?" Elena asked.

"Like silt," Yusuf continued, gesturing with his book, turned to a page, and read from it. "Like 'well-sorted aeolian deposits, Munsell number 10YR 6/4, light yellowish brown.'" He snorted, and waved the book. "These guys dug by locus, by context number." He sputtered, his expression twisting into a look of profound, academic distaste. "Not by units the way God intended. I bet they believe method is theory laden. Probably spend half their time debating the semiotics of a trowel." He paused, realized he'd lost track of the thread. "One by one, we arrive. We drink her gin. We argue about whether the 1950s surf club has the correct fat content in its burger patties—which Lena and Raj are currently debating with alarming intensity, by the way. And we wait for Mira to tell us if we’re still archaeologists or if we’re all about to become curators of 'sanitized nostalgia.'"

"You think that's what the proposal is?"

"The proposal," Yusuf said, his voice dropping an octave, "is an insurance policy written by people who think the past was a mistake. They want the 'Essential Experience' of the Himalayas without the part where your toes turn black and fall off. They want the 'essential' feeling of 1200 BCE without Bronze Age collapse. They want the pattern on the pot, but they don't want the fear that the pot is the only thing standing between you and starvation."

"Mira's making a point with these resorts, isn't she?" Elena said, looking around at the perfect, Art Deco geometry.

"She’s showing off," Yusuf said with a glint of gallows humor. "She’s showing the network that she can do 'Essential' better than they can. This club is perfect. It’s quintessential 1920s. But it’s not her work. It’s her recreation. She’s proving that if she *wanted* to build theme parks, she’d be the best at it. But she chooses the scorpions instead."

Kenji let the silence hang for a beat, picking at a loose thread on his beach shirt. "Method *is* theory-laden, you know," he said, finally picking up the gauntlet. "You can't measure the charge of an electron without the concept of an electron. The units we dig in aren't just boxes, Yusuf. They're questions we're asking the dirt."

Yusuf snorted into his gin but didn't argue.

"And the network wants to take away the choice," Kenji said softly, the playfulness finally draining from his voice.

Yusuf nodded, his large frame casting a long shadow in the deepening rose-colored light of the artificial sunset. "They want to turn our vocations into jobs. Auditable, predictable, risk-free jobs. I’ve spent twenty years learning how to simulate the slow suffocation of a blizzard, and now they tell me it’s a 'cognitive burden.'"

He raised his glass in a mock toast. "To the death adders. May they never learn to read governance proposals."

Elena and Kenji raised their own glasses, the clink of ice sounding sharp in the deepening quiet. They drank together, a silent agreement.

"We're going to see them tomorrow," Elena said. "The death adders,that is. The Lapita site. We thought a professional field trip was in order."

Yusuf’s eyes brightened with a dangerous, playful light. "Excellent. I'll come along. I want to see Kenji try to explain late 20th Century postmodernism to a woman who’s been weaving pandanus for three thousand simulated years."

The three of them sat in the gathering twilight, the jazz record coming to an end with a long, rhythmic hiss. The Jazz Age was beautiful, but the silence that followed it felt like the truth. 

"Sixty-two percent," Yusuf whispered, seemingly to himself. "The tide is coming in fast."
