# The Plan

The receiving room was sparse—a low table, cushions, windows that looked out onto the raw Pacific. No reconstruction here. Just Mira's habitat, functional and unadorned.

They gathered early. Elena counted nine: herself, Mira, Kenji, Yusuf, Raj, two colleagues from the dinner whose names she was embarrassed not to remember, and—to her surprise—Lena, who had arrived last and taken a cushion near the door.

"I'm not sure I'm opposed," Lena had said when Mira raised an eyebrow. "But I'm sure I want to understand what opposing looks like."

The formality of the dinner was gone. So was some of the defensive tension. What remained was a room full of people who had spent years arguing about methodology, trying to find common ground on something larger.

The vote count had crossed the two-thirds threshold overnight—seventy-one percent of sanctuaries now in favor of NG-2047-31. Technically, individual sanctuaries could still change their votes until the resolution window closed, but no one in the room expected that to happen. The proposal would pass. The only question now was whether it could be vetoed.

Kenji had arranged for one of his AI systems to facilitate. It manifested as a soft geometric pattern hovering above the table's center—visible through cortics or glasses, invisible to the unaugmented eye. "I can summarize your options if that would be helpful," it said.

"Please," Mira said.

"You have two formal veto paths and several informal influence channels." The pattern shifted, organizing itself into a simple diagram. "The formal options: First, the **Guardian Triad** can block the proposal by majority vote. This requires demonstrating that the proposal violates network principles or creates irreversible harm. Second, a **User Veto**—two-thirds of active end-users can override the operator vote. This has never been achieved for a governance proposal."

"What counts as an active end-user?" Raj asked.

"Two physical sanctuary visits within the past standard year," the system replied. "The threshold exists to ensure voting weight reflects genuine engagement rather than passive registration. Currently, that's approximately fourteen million qualifying users."

"And the informal channels?" Elena asked.

"The Operating Company retains administrative discretion during implementation. The Executive could delay, request amendments, or recommend the Triad exercise caution. Additionally, public pressure—if sufficient—can shift operator votes before the resolution window closes, though historical precedent suggests this is unlikely once a proposal crosses the supermajority threshold."

The pattern dimmed slightly, awaiting further questions. But the room had already moved on—people pulling up their own research, cross-referencing notes, murmuring to their personal AIs.

"The Guardian Triad is our best shot," Yusuf said. He'd clearly been thinking about this. "But we need to frame it carefully. The AI seat is charter-bound to privilege reversibility—we emphasize that the proposal creates permanent exclusions. The Legacy seat remembers how 'temporary measures' become permanent. The Contemporary Trust seat hates anything that looks like elite capture."

"So we present it as founder overreach," Raj said. "Not populist overreach."

"Exactly."

"I'll take the Guardian Appeal," Mira said. Her voice was calm, almost clinical. "I can make the case for pluralism. It's my site they're trying to define out of existence."

"I'll work it with you," Yusuf said. "Two founders carry more weight than one. And if we're arguing about the deep history of the network, we need someone who still digs in the dirt."

"And if they say no?" one of the unnamed colleagues asked.

"Then we escalate to the User Veto." Elena looked around the room. "Fourteen million eligible users. We need two-thirds of them to override the operators."

"Most of them don't even know this proposal exists," Kenji said. "The constraint is attention, not sentiment. If people understood what was happening, they'd care. But they don't follow governance—they follow experiences." He shook his head slowly. "Standard awareness campaigns aren't going to cut through. We're competing against... everything else."

"It's a long shot," Yusuf said flatly.

"It is." Elena looked around the room. "But we're not unknown voices. Between everyone here, we've shaped how millions of people understand what sanctuaries can be. That has to count for something."

"Maybe," Kenji said. His eyes were distant, already calculating. "I'll work on it. See what our reach actually looks like when we need it to matter."

"And the Executive?" Mira asked.

"That's me." Elena felt the weight of it settle onto her shoulders. "They chose my philosophy as the template. That's a way in—he'll take a meeting with the person he's trying to canonize. And if I can show him the process was captured, that my approach is being used to exclude rather than include, he might reconsider."

"He's been pushing standardization for years," Yusuf said flatly. "This proposal is exactly what he wants."

"I know. But he believes in process too." Elena met his eyes. "We have to try everything."

The room was quiet. Outside, waves broke against the habitat's foundation—real waves, engineered for erosion patterns that matched the archaeological record.

"Henrik and Chen are going to oppose us," Mira said quietly. "They believe in the proposal. Genuinely."

"I know."

"They're not wrong to want what they want." Mira's voice was flat. "They're our colleagues, and they want the proposal to pass, and they have reasons."

"Then we convince them," Elena said. "Or we work around them. But we don't let their sincerity stop us from fighting for what's right."

Yusuf raised an imaginary cup. "To the death adders."

Kenji mimed the gesture. "To the buffalo we never herded."

Elena joined them. "To all the arguments."

One by one, the others raised their hands—Raj, the two colleagues, even Lena after a moment's hesitation.

Mira was last. She lifted her hand to meet theirs. "To finishing what we started."

They held the moment—nine people who had spent years disagreeing about everything, finally trying to build something together.

Outside, the waves kept breaking. The resolution window was still open. And somewhere out there, fourteen million users were going about their lives, unaware that anything was at stake.

They had work to do.
