# Chapter 15: The Decision

## Kenji

---

Kenji started with the question that had been bothering him since the call ended.

"How do you get attention?" he asked his swarm. "Real attention—not a glance, not a share, but the kind where someone actually stops and thinks. We've got the arguments. When people engage, eighty-three percent vote our way. But most people haven't engaged at all. They haven't seen Solène's essay. They haven't seen the proposal. They're not ignoring us—they just don't know we exist."

His personal swarm had evolved over decades into something like an extended family—dozens of specialized agents with distinct voices, optimized for different kinds of thinking. He'd configured them for adversarial brainstorming—propose solutions, then tear them apart.

"Give me options," he said. "Every plausible way to reach fourteen million people in ten days. Then tell me why each one won't work."

The swarm was fast.

**Mass coordinated outreach—personal messages from supporters to their networks**: "Attempted in Week 1. Conversion rate 0.3%. Even with perfect execution across all seventeen thousand essay sharers, projected reach is under 2% of eligible voters."

**Amplification through high-visibility figures**: "Solène's essay represents current ceiling for influencer-style reach. Additional celebrity endorsements show diminishing returns; audience overlap exceeds 70% across sanctuary-adjacent channels."

**Gamification of voting process**: "Legally and ethically problematic. Incentivizing votes distorts preference expression and would face immediate challenge from Operating Company."

**Targeted relevance—personal AI assistants flagging the proposal to individual users**: "Requires users to have configured interest profiles that include governance topics. Fewer than 8% of eligible voters have such configurations. The remaining 92% have filtered governance into background noise."

**Paid advertising—purchasing attention directly**: "Technically feasible. Attention markets remain functional for commercial purposes. However, political and governance advertising faces severe trust penalties. Users have learned to discount paid advocacy; conversion rates for governance ads average 0.02%. Additionally, well-funded counter-advertising from proposal supporters would neutralize reach advantage."

**Manufacturing a crisis to create urgency**: "Credibility cost exceeds potential gain. Revelation probability approaches certainty over ten-day window. Would permanently damage coalition reputation."

Kenji watched the options pile up and get discarded. Each one felt like something someone had already tried, somewhere, sometime.

"What about novel approaches? Something no one's done before?"

"Novelty alone is insufficient," one agent responded. "Novel content is produced at a rate that exceeds human capacity to process. The average user encounters approximately 4,000 novel signals per day. Most are filtered unconsciously. Novelty does not guarantee attention; it merely qualifies for the competition."

"So what *does* guarantee attention?"

The swarm paused—a fraction of a second that felt deliberate.

"Guarantee is too strong. But historical analysis suggests one pattern with higher-than-baseline success: salience through perceived stakes. Humans are calibrated to notice threats, opportunities, and anomalies. A signal that suggests high stakes for the sender tends to interrupt normal filtering more effectively than content alone."

"High stakes for the sender," Kenji repeated slowly. "You mean, if *we* have something to lose, people pay attention?"

"Yes. An action that costs the actor more than expected creates an anomaly. The observer asks: *Why would they do that?* The question itself generates attention. The cost is the hook."

Kenji sat with that for a while. Something was there—a shape he couldn't quite see.

"Let me think about this," he said. "I need to talk to someone."

He called Elena.

She was at the Axis, still waiting for her meeting with the Executive. Her face on the display looked tired, but she perked up when he started explaining.

"My swarm called it 'deliberate sacrifice,'" he said. "The idea is that in a world where everything is cheap, the only way to prove you're serious is to do something costly on purpose. The cost itself is the message."

Elena was quiet for a moment. "That sounds familiar. Let me ask my father."

"Jordan?"

"He's old. He's read everything. If this is a real thing, he'll know what it's called."

---

The response came back four hours later—light-speed delay from Mercury.

Jordan's face was weathered and warm on the display. Behind him, the greenhouse glowed with filtered sunlight.

"Your friend Kenji is onto something," he said. "What he's describing has a name. It's called costly signaling theory. Shows up in biology, economics, anthropology—anywhere you have actors trying to prove something to each other in the absence of trust."

He leaned back, settling into the explanation.

"The core idea is simple. Signals that are cheap to produce can be faked. If I can say 'I love you' with no effort, how do you know I mean it? But if I say it by doing something hard—something I wouldn't do unless I meant it—now the signal carries weight. The cost makes it honest."

"In biology, it's peacock tails. The tail is expensive to grow and makes the bird easier for predators to catch. That's the point—only a genuinely healthy peacock can afford the handicap. The tail *proves* the fitness precisely because it's a burden."

"In economics, it's warranties and money-back guarantees. A company that offers a warranty is saying: *We're so confident in our product that we'll take the hit if it fails.* The willingness to absorb cost signals quality."

"In anthropology, it's ritual sacrifice, pilgrimage, initiation ordeals. The harder the ritual, the more it proves commitment to the group."

He paused, looking directly at the camera.

"The question for your cohort is: what's your peacock tail? What can you sacrifice that proves you mean it—proves it so clearly that even people who aren't paying attention will notice?"

The message ended.

Elena stared at the blank screen.

*What's your peacock tail?*

She didn't know yet. But she knew the question.

## The Meeting

---

They gathered at Lapita Horizons two days later. The same receiving room where they'd toasted to death adders—but the mood had shifted. Something was crystallizing.

Kenji went first, walking them through his conversation with the swarm. "They called it 'deliberate sacrifice.' The idea that cost itself is the signal."

"My father gave it a name," Elena added. "Costly signaling theory. It's real—shows up across biology, economics, anthropology. The core principle is that cheap signals get ignored because they're easy to fake. Only expensive signals carry information."

Solène nodded slowly. "The agent swarm I consulted said something similar. They called them 'indexical commitment devices'—actions whose meaning comes from their cost structure rather than their content."

"So we all arrived at the same place," Mira said. "We need to do something costly. Something that proves we're serious."

"But what?" Yusuf asked. "We've already spent time, spent attention, made arguments. What's left?"

The room was quiet.

"Our reputations?" Elena offered. "But reputation is... diffuse. Hard to sacrifice visibly."

"Our time." Kenji shook his head. "We're already spending that. It's not enough."

Mira spoke slowly, as if testing each word. "Our work."

Everyone looked at her.

"Our intellectual property. The design foundations, the proprietary techniques, the systems we've spent decades building." Her voice was steady. "The things that make our sanctuaries *ours*."

"You're talking about... giving it away?" Yusuf said.

"I'm talking about committing it. Irrevocably. If the proposal passes, everything we've built becomes public property. If the veto succeeds, we keep it. Either way, the commitment is made the moment we sign. We can't take it back."

"Smart contracts," Kenji said quietly. "Cryptographically locked. The transfer triggers automatically based on the outcome."

"Yes."

The silence stretched.

"That's everything," Yusuf said. "That's our economic foundation. Our competitive advantage. Our legacy."

"I know." Mira met his eyes. "That's why it might work."

Elena felt something shift in her chest. "The signal has to cost more than you want to pay. That's what makes it honest."

"Will it be enough?" Solène asked. "Will people notice?"

"I don't know." Mira looked around the room. "But I know that everything else hasn't worked. And I know that in eight days, the resolution window closes."

She stood.

"I'm going to do this. My IP, my techniques, my life's work—committed to a public trust, triggered if we lose. The question is whether I do it alone, or whether we do it together."

One by one, they looked at each other.

One by one, they nodded.

That night, Kenji's swarm ran the projections.

If the announcement reached 40% of eligible users... if the conversion rate matched the 83% of engaged voters... if the timing held...

The numbers were tight. But they weren't impossible.

For the first time in days, something other than despair stirred in the room.

They were about to bet everything they'd built on a theory about peacock tails.
