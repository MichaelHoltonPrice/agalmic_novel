# Chapter 15: The Decision

## Kenji

---

Kenji started with the question that had been bothering him since the call ended.

"How do you get attention?" he asked his swarm. "Real attention—not a glance, not a share, but the kind where someone actually stops and thinks. We've got the arguments. When people engage, eighty-three percent vote our way. But most people haven't engaged at all. They haven't seen Solène's essay. They haven't seen the proposal. They're not ignoring us—they just don't know we exist."

His personal swarm had evolved over decades into something like an extended family—dozens of specialized agents with distinct voices, optimized for different kinds of thinking. He'd configured them for adversarial brainstorming—propose solutions, then tear them apart.

"Give me options," he said. "Every plausible way to reach fourteen million people in ten days. Then tell me why each one won't work."

The swarm was fast.

**Mass coordinated outreach—personal messages from supporters to their networks**: "Attempted in Week 1. Conversion rate 0.3%. Even with perfect execution across all seventeen thousand essay sharers, projected reach is under 2% of eligible voters."

**Amplification through high-visibility figures**: "Solène's essay represents current ceiling for influencer-style reach. Additional celebrity endorsements show diminishing returns; audience overlap exceeds 70% across sanctuary-adjacent channels."

**Gamification of voting process**: "Legally and ethically problematic. Incentivizing votes distorts preference expression and would face immediate challenge from Operating Company."

**Targeted relevance—personal AI assistants flagging the proposal to individual users**: "Requires users to have configured interest profiles that include governance topics. Fewer than 8% of eligible voters have such configurations. The remaining 92% have filtered governance into background noise."

**Paid advertising—purchasing attention directly**: "Technically feasible. Attention markets remain functional for commercial purposes. However, political and governance advertising faces severe trust penalties. Users have learned to discount paid advocacy; conversion rates for governance ads average 0.02%. Additionally, well-funded counter-advertising from proposal supporters would neutralize reach advantage."

**Manufacturing a crisis to create urgency**: "Credibility cost exceeds potential gain. Revelation probability approaches certainty over ten-day window. Would permanently damage coalition reputation. Legally and ethically problematic."

Kenji watched the options pile up and get discarded. Each one felt like something someone had already tried, somewhere, sometime.

"What about novel approaches? Something no one's done before?"

"Novelty alone is insufficient," one agent responded. "Novel content is produced at a rate that exceeds human capacity to process. The average user encounters approximately 4,000 novel signals per day. Most are filtered unconsciously. Novelty does not guarantee attention; it merely qualifies for the competition."

"So what *does* guarantee attention?"

The swarm paused—a fraction of a second that felt deliberate.

"Guarantee is too strong. But historical analysis suggests one pattern with higher-than-baseline success: salience through perceived stakes. Humans are calibrated to notice threats, opportunities, and anomalies. A signal that suggests high stakes for the sender tends to interrupt normal filtering more effectively than content alone."

"High stakes for the sender," Kenji repeated slowly. "You mean, if *we* have something to lose, people pay attention?"

"Yes. An action that costs the actor more than expected creates an anomaly. The observer asks: *Why would they do that?* The question itself generates attention. The cost is the hook."

Kenji sat with that for a while. Something was there—a shape he couldn't quite see.

*The cost is the hook.*

But what did that mean, practically? He needed to think. He needed a drink.

---

The Tahitian Dream. Kenji had always liked Mira's 1980s resort—the beach, the synth-pop, the bartender with the failed marriage. A good place to think.

He walked down the beach toward the bar, mind still turning over the swarm's last phrase. *The cost is the hook.* It felt important, but he couldn't quite grasp it.

Movement caught his eye. Two figures on lounge chairs, watching the waves.

One of them was Elena.

The other—

Kenji stopped short.

"Jordan?"

The older man turned, and his weathered face broke into a smile. "Kenji. It's been years."

"Nine," Kenji said automatically. "The Luna centennial." He looked between them, confused. "What are you doing here?"

"Visiting my daughter." Jordan rose, extending a hand. "She sounded like she needed someone who thinks about systems."

Kenji shook his hand warmly, still processing. Jordan Smith, Elena's father—127 years old, systems theorist, lived on Mercury. They'd met several times over the decades, traded ideas about institutional dynamics, shared a memorable argument about entropy and meaning at a conference that no longer existed.

"I didn't know you were coming," Kenji said.

"Neither did I, until about five days ago." Jordan glanced at Elena. "The message she sent after the Executive meeting... I couldn't just sit in my greenhouse."

Elena gestured at an empty chair. "Sit. You look like you need a drink."

Kenji sat. The bartender, without being asked, slid a glass toward him—something bright and tropical, the same as he always ordered.

"Mira's homework assignment?" Elena asked.

"Yeah." Kenji stared at his drink. "I've been talking to my swarm for hours. Trying to figure out what we're missing."

"And?"

"They gave me a list of options. Mass outreach, influencers, advertising, manufactured crisis—all dead ends. Nothing works at the scale we need." He paused. "But at the end, they said something I can't stop thinking about."

Jordan leaned forward. "What?"

"They said that to break through the noise, you need 'salience through perceived stakes.' That humans are calibrated to notice when the *sender* has something to lose." Kenji looked up. "They said: 'An action that costs the actor more than expected creates an anomaly. The observer asks: why would they do that? The cost is the hook.'"

He spread his hands. "But I don't know what to do with it."

Jordan was smiling—not amused, but recognizing something.

"Your AI already told you the answer," he said. "It just didn't give you the name."

"What do you mean?"

"What you're describing—it's a real thing. It's studied. It's called costly signaling theory."

Kenji blinked. "Costly signaling."

"Shows up in biology, economics, anthropology. Anywhere you have actors trying to prove something to each other in the absence of trust." Jordan settled back into his chair. "The core idea is simple. Signals that are cheap to produce can be faked. If I can say 'I love you' without effort, how do you know I mean it? But if I prove it by doing something hard—something I wouldn't do unless I meant it—now the signal carries weight. The cost makes it honest."

"Give me examples."

"Biology: peacock tails. The tail is expensive to grow and makes the bird easier for predators to catch. That's the point—only a genuinely healthy peacock can afford the handicap. The tail *proves* the fitness precisely because it's a burden."

"Economics: warranties and money-back guarantees. A company that offers a warranty is saying: 'We're so confident in our product that we'll take the hit if it fails.' The willingness to absorb cost signals quality."

"Anthropology: ritual sacrifice, pilgrimage, initiation ordeals. The harder the ritual, the more it proves commitment to the group. You can't fake a pilgrimage. You either made the journey or you didn't."

Kenji stared at him. The shape he'd been reaching for was suddenly clear.

"So when my swarm said 'the cost is the hook'—"

"They were describing costly signaling. They gave you the mechanism. They just didn't give you the framework." Jordan looked at Elena, then back at Kenji. "The question for your group is: what's your pilgrimage? What can you sacrifice that proves you mean it—proves it so clearly that even people who aren't paying attention will notice?"

*What's your peacock tail?*

Kenji didn't know yet. But he knew the question now.

## The Meeting

---

They gathered at Lapita Horizons that evening. The same receiving room where they'd toasted to death adders, but the mood had shifted. Mira and Yusuf had arrived from their transit. Kenji had called Solène. Jordan sat in the corner, listening.

Kenji went first, walking them through his swarm's analysis and Jordan's framework.

"Costly signaling," Mira repeated. "The proof is in what you're willing to lose."

"Right. The sacrifice has to be real, or it doesn't work. And it has to be visible—people need to see what you're giving up."

"So what do we have?" Yusuf asked. "What's even costly anymore? In an agalmic world?"

The question hung there. It was the right question.

"Money doesn't work," Kenji said. "Everyone has material abundance. You can't signal commitment by spending credits—there's nothing heroic about buying things."

"Time has some cost," Elena said slowly. "But we already used that. Mira and Yusuf traveled to the Guardians in person instead of appearing remotely. That was a signal."

"And it wasn't enough," Yusuf said. "Four days of transit. The Guardians noted it, I think. But it didn't change the outcome."

"Because time is recoverable," Jordan said from his corner. "You spent four days, but you got them back on the other side. The cost was real but temporary. For a signal to cut through the noise you're describing, it needs to be... permanent. Irrecoverable. Non-fungible."

"Our reputations?" Elena offered. "But reputation is diffuse. Hard to sacrifice visibly. And in a world where everyone can rebuild, even a damaged reputation doesn't feel permanent."

Silence.

"What's permanent?" Solène asked. "What can't you get back?"

Kenji thought about it. What couldn't you replace in a world of abundance? What was truly scarce when production costs were near zero?

"Your vocation," he said quietly. "Not your career—careers are just roles. But your vocation. The thing you've spent your life building. The work that makes you *you*."

Mira looked up.

"Our work," she said, as if testing each word.

Everyone looked at her.

"Our intellectual property. The design foundations, the proprietary techniques, the systems we've spent decades building." Her voice was steady. "The things that make our sanctuaries *ours*."

"You're talking about... giving it away?" Yusuf said.

"I'm talking about committing it. Irrevocably. To a public trust that funds universal basic services." She paused. "Not triggered by losing—triggered by *finality*. The moment the proposal process ends, whether we win or lose, the transfer happens. We can't take it back. We can't hedge."

"That's everything," Yusuf said quietly. "That's our legacy."

"I know." Mira met his eyes. "That's why it might work. A signal that costs nothing proves nothing. A signal that costs everything proves everything."

"But if we win—" Solène started.

"If we win, we still lose the IP. That's the point." Mira's voice was calm. "The sacrifice is unconditional. We're not saying 'we'll give this up if we lose.' We're saying 'we've already given it up, regardless of outcome.' The commitment is made the moment we sign. The outcome just determines whether the transfer happens in victory or defeat."

Elena felt something shift in her chest. Her father's words echoed: *The cost makes it honest.*

"Smart contracts," Kenji said quietly. "Cryptographically locked. The transfer executes automatically when the resolution window closes. We can't stop it even if we wanted to."

"Yes."

Jordan spoke up. "Will it be enough? Will people notice?"

"I don't know." Mira looked around the room. "But I know that everything else hasn't worked. And I know that in eight days, the resolution window closes. After that, our sanctuaries become non-compliant. We either conform or we're out of the network."

She stood.

"I'm going to do this. My IP, my techniques, my life's work—committed to a public trust, unconditionally. The question is whether I do it alone, or whether we do it together."

One by one, they looked at each other.

One by one, they nodded.
