# Chapter 10: The Deep Past

## Elena

The transition to the Lapita site was not cushioned by 20th-century nostalgia. There were no ceiling fans here, no Blue Hawaiis, no Art Deco symmetry. 

As Elena, Kenji, and Yusuf stepped out of the transit lock, the air hit them like a physical blow. It was thick with the smell of stagnant water, decaying vegetation, and the faint, sweet scent of fermented sago. The humidity was near-saturation. Within seconds, Elena’s linen shirt—a relic of the Tiare Club—clung to her skin.

They stood on a narrow ridge overlooking a vast, swampy estuary. Below them, a cluster of thatched-roof structures sat on high stilts above the black, tea-colored water—the village. Outrigger canoes were tethered to the pilings, and smoke from several hearths curled upward through the heavy air. 

"I'm no expert," Elena said, adjusting her glasses to filter the glare reflecting off the stagnant water, "but aren't the well-known Lapita sites on New Caledonia and the Solomons? Thing is, last night you toasted death adders, Yusuf, and I looked up their biogeographical distribution. They are on mainland New Guinea, but not New Caledonia or the Solomons. What gives?"

Yusuf nodded, a slow, appreciative tilt of his head as if he’d been waiting for someone to catch the discrepancy. He didn't answer immediately. Instead, Kenji stepped in.

"What gives," Kenji said, his eyes darting as his cortics overlaid archaeological schematics on the scene below, "is that Mira's betting the Lapita didn't just stay on the small islands. Look at the thatch. She used sago palm fronds for the roofing, but the structural weave is still Bismarck-style. It’s a jarring mix."

"Jarring," Elena scoffed. "Only if you're in on the joke."

Kenji nodded. "I read up on the Lapita when Mira started her work, but, yeah, this I just got from my AI," he admitted. "She's built a 'what if' out of sago and stilt-houses. That's Mira for you—meticulous to a fault, but willing to stick out her tongue at the orthodoxy."

They descended the ridge, their feet sinking into dark, anaerobic muck. From deeper within the sago palm swamp, the rhythmic *thwack-thwack* of stone adzes echoed across the water—people working the pith in long, hollowed-out logs. Flies buzzed around. She swatted a mosquito. Her hand came away bloody. Elena wondered if these mosquitos carried malaria.

"She hasn't pulled any punches with the biology," Elena noted, wiping a smear of dark muck from her arm.

"She never does," Yusuf said. He was looking at his own hand, perhaps checking a readout on his palm or just feeling the grit. "Mira thinks that as soon as you make the past comfortable, you've stopped doing boundary archaeology and started doing interior design. In the Network, we curate experiences. Mira recreates consequences. You don't adjust the environment for the visitor here; you adjust the visitor for the environment."

They reached the edge of the village. A group of villagers—AI-driven, probably, but their skin and movements indistinguishable from human—were working with clay. They were decorating pottery with the intricate, dentate-stamped patterns that were the signature of the Lapita culture. 

"So the adders," Elena said, stopping as they approached a thicket of sago palms. "She really built this whole reconstruction on the New Guinea mainland just to include them?"

"Maybe." He smiled. "Probably. But the mainland setting is consistent with the evidence and she probably belives that if they were the voyagers we think they were-the ancestors of the seafaring Polynesians-they wouldn't have just ignored the largest landmass in the region. He paused, a slow, grim smile spreading across his face. "Welcome to the Sepik."

"The Sepik", Echo offered helpfully in hear ear, "a river and region on the northern coast of New Guinea."

"It's more than the pottery, Elena," Yusuf said. He gestured vaguely toward the palms where the water met the jungle. "You can't see the containment from here. No markers, no geofencing poles. Mira uses the ridge-line and a three-degree temperature drop in the air-curtain to keep the biodiversity where it belongs."

"Where did she get the adders?" Kenji asked, squinting into the shadows.

"Bred from lineages on Earth," Yusuf said. "Mira spent five years getting the venom yield right. They’re part of the record here. If you’re walking the coastal paths at night and you don't have your cortics or," he nodded towards Elena, "glasses on high-alert, you’re playing the same game the Lapita played."

Elena looked at the dense undergrowth. She could hear the rustle of leaves, the distant call of a bird, and the constant, rhythmic lap of the water against the stilts. It was beautiful, but the beauty was edged with something sharp.

"She has visitors here," Yusuf continued. "Real ones. Not tourists. People who want to feel what it’s like to live in a world where a small mistake—a slip on a stilt, a bite from a snake, a fever that doesn't break—actually matters. They stay for weeks, pounding sago, dodging adders, and eating whatever the AI villagers catch."

"The permissive-tier," Elena whispered.

"Exactly. The thing the proposal would ban." Yusuf picked up a shard of discarded pottery. "The network says this is 'unnecessary harm.' They say we can give people the 'feeling' of 1000 BCE without the actual death adders or malaria. They want the pattern on the pot, but not the sweat on the brow."

They walked along the edge of the swamp. A young man was repairing an outrigger, his hands moving with a practiced, rhythmic grace. There was a scar on his leg, a jagged line that looked like it had been earned from a coral scrape and allowed to heal naturally.

"That scar," Elena said. "It's not a simulation."

"It's a record," Yusuf said. "In Mira's world, you keep your scars. They're part of your biography. In your world, Elena, the scars are healed within hours."

"I build for the emotional resonance," Elena defended. "I don't think you need permanent disfigurement to understand the Lapita people."

"Maybe not," Kenji said, though his voice lacked its usual joviality. "But without the risk of the disfigurement, is it the same understanding?"

They stood in silence for a long moment, the heavy air pressing down on them. Elena looked across the black water toward the far side of the cylinder, where the horizon curved upward toward a world she couldn't see. Mira was out there somewhere, in the middle of this raw, uncompromising reality.

"She's not hiding," Elena realized. "She's working."

"She’s always working," Yusuf said. "And the proposal is at sixty-four percent."

The contrast between the 1980s resort and this raw, humid village felt like a physical weight. Elena realized that the "reunion" wasn't just about friendship. It was a comparative study. Mira had laid out her range—the resorts, the history, the risks—and left them to find their own way through it.

"We should head back," Kenji said, wiping sweat from his forehead. "The others will be gathering by now."

As they turned back toward the transit lock, Elena caught a glimpse of something moving in the undergrowth—a flash of dark scales, a silent, deadly presence. The death adder. It didn't care about governance proposals or network standards. It was just there, waiting.

And for the first time, Elena felt the weight of what they might lose.
