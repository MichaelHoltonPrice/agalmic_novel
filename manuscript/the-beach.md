# The Beach

## Elena

---

The transit pod's deceleration was gentle, the kind that fooled you into thinking you'd been stationary all along. Elena watched the viewport as Mira's habitat resolved itself—another rotating cylinder like her own, but as it filled the window, greens and blues washed over her instead of rustic hues. A different world entirely.

She stepped out into humidity and noted, professionally, how Mira had calibrated it—the salt-to-organic ratio in the air, the way the moisture settled without becoming oppressive. Good work. Different from her own environmental algorithms, but equally deliberate. Elena's prairie pulled moisture out; Mira's islands wrapped you in it. Both choices, both defensible.

A message pinged her glasses: *Follow the yellow brick road. —K*

Before she could reply, her AR overlay shimmered and the corridor transformed. The brushed steel floor was now paved with golden bricks, slightly uneven, gleaming with a warmth that had no physical source. Stylized poppies bloomed along the edges of her vision, swaying in a breeze she couldn't feel. Somewhere ahead, a faint orchestral swell promised emerald towers.

Elena laughed despite herself. "Echo, is this—"

"Kenji's work," Echo confirmed. "One of his ambient systems generated it approximately ninety seconds ago, when your transit pod entered Mira's approach corridor. The theming appears to be *The Wizard of Oz*, 1939. He's drawing on Mira's public infrastructure blueprints—she must have granted him spatial access."

"He built me a yellow brick road in ninety seconds."

"He built *systems* that can build yellow brick roads in ninety seconds, given the right permissions. There's a difference."

That was Kenji's philosophy in miniature: years of foundational work so that everything afterward could be spontaneous. Elena shook her head and followed the golden path.

Like most boundary archaeologists, Mira had a range of themed sanctuaries within her habitat. But unlike Elena—who canalized her transitions, letting visitors drift from one era to the next through carefully graded landscapes—Mira kept her worlds separate. The infrastructure between them was deliberately visible beneath Kenji's overlay: brushed steel corridors, utilitarian lighting, the honest hum of life support. No pretense. Each reconstruction was a complete thing, and you entered it knowing you were crossing a threshold.

Informational displays marked her progress, their text wrapped in art-deco frames that Kenji's system had added: *Lapita Horizons (1000 BCE) — 2.3 km. The Tiare Club (1926) — 1.1 km. The Tahitian Dream (1987) — 0.4 km.* At the end of the corridor, a simple pressure door waited. In her AR view, it was flanked by two tin soldiers who saluted as she approached.

She touched the panel. The door slid open, the overlay dissolved, and the world changed entirely.

A 1980s resort sprawled before her. Thatched-roof bungalows with ceiling fans turning lazily. Lounge chairs with bright striped cushions. A poolside bar where a bartender—AI-driven, but dressed in a Hawaiian shirt with period-appropriate hair—was mixing something pink. From hidden speakers, synth-heavy pop drifted across the beach: Duran Duran, or something close.

And there, in two lounge chairs positioned with the precision of old rivals, were Kenji and Yusuf.

Kenji spotted her first. He was dressed for the beach—loose linen shirt unbuttoned over swim trunks, bare feet, a towel slung over one shoulder. He surged up from his chair with a grin that hadn't changed since the Luna Conference.

"Elena!"

Yusuf rose more slowly, a mountain of a man unfolding from the wicker. He was holding a book in one hand and something neon-blue in the other, and his expression was set in its default state: profound scholarly melancholy. But when he saw her, the melancholy cracked, just for a moment.

"Finally," Yusuf said, his voice a rich baritone. "Someone with taste. Kenji's been trying to explain postmodern Mesoamerican fusion to me for the past three hours."

"It's not *fusion*," Kenji protested, pulling Elena into a hug. "It's *synthesis*. There's a difference."

"The difference is marketing." Yusuf embraced her next, a crushing thing that smelled of juniper and old paper. "Elena. You look tired. Not 'transit pod' tired. More like 'carrying the weight of a tradition' tired."

"Is it that obvious?"

"To us? Yes." He released her and gestured toward a third lounge chair, already positioned with a drink waiting on the side table. "Sit. We've been comparing notes."

Elena settled into the chair and picked up the drink—a Blue Hawaii, violently azure, garnished with three paper umbrellas. She took a sip. It tasted like pineapple, coconut, and a type of sugar that had probably been banned in the 21st century.

"When did you two arrive?"

"Yesterday," Kenji said. "I reached out to Mira after I saw the proposal. Turns out I wasn't the only one."

"Yusuf was already here," he added. "Reading excavation reports on the beach. In the 1980s. Like a normal person."

"The lighting is good," Yusuf said, without a trace of irony. He held up the battered book. "Lapita Homeland Project, 1985 field season. I'm cross-referencing Mira's simulation parameters against the original soil matrices. She's interpolating the Bismarck stratigraphy, which is defensible, but she's also introduced sago palm variability that the record doesn't support."

"You came to a beach resort to audit the host's methodology?"

"I came because Mira asked. The audit is a bonus, freebie." He took a long sip of his drink. "Besides, her simulation approach is just—"

"—guesses with better graphics," Elena and Kenji finished in unison.

Yusuf glared at them. "I was going to say 'epistemologically adventurous.'"

"You were going to say 'guesses with better graphics,'" Kenji said confidently. "You've been saying it since Luna."

"It bears repeating." But Yusuf's glare softened into something almost fond. "All these years, and you two still can't let me finish a sentence."

Elena leaned back in her chair, feeling something loosen in her chest. The reconstructed sun was perfect—warm without burning, the light golden and slightly hazy in a way that said *late afternoon, tropical, no obligations*. For a moment, she could almost forget why they were here.

"So," she said. "The manifesto—"

Kenji snorted and threw a handful of sand at her. It scattered across her legs, warm and fine-grained. Some got in her drink. She took a sip anyway.

"Hey!" she yelled, a little belated.

"There's time for that later." He signaled the bartender for another round. "Right now, you're going to tell me how the Morrison arc turned out. Last I heard, you were agonizing over whether the daughter's fever should break twice or three times."

Elena crunched a piece of ice, feeling the faint, mineral grit of the sand between her teeth. "Three times. It was the only way to get the pacing right. But I'm still getting flagged for 'excessive emotional friction' by the automated audits. Apparently, three fevers is a 'cognitive burden.'"

Yusuf snorted. "Audits. The network wants us to build cathedrals but keep the ceiling height to code."

"I had a visitor last month," Kenji said, "file a formal grievance because the cacao in my Aztec market was 'too bitter and spicy.' She wanted it sweetened. I told her the Aztecs didn't have sugar—they drank it with chili and achiote. She said I was 'prioritizing authenticity over accessibility.'"

"Did you give in?"

"I gave her a separate cup with agave nectar on the side. She poured in half the bottle, took one sip, and said it 'still tasted wrong.' Filed a follow-up complaint about 'inadequate flavor calibration.'"

They lapsed into a comfortable rhythm, trading stories of visitor complaints and methodological compromises. Yusuf told them about a French tourist who had insisted that his high-altitude Himalayan reconstruction was "too cold" and demanded a refund. Kenji described his ongoing war with a network reviewer who kept flagging his Olmec colossal heads as "intimidating to children." Elena shared her latest battle with the sensory calibration team, who wanted to reduce the "olfactory intensity" of her cattle drives.

"Did you hear about Silas?" Kenji asked, reaching for his drink.

Elena sat up. "Silas? He was the most stubborn guy in the network. What happened?"

"He quit the Colonial America project. Moved to a 1950s suburbia sim. Says he wanted to work with lawns. 'Low stakes, high fidelity,' that was his quote."

"Traitor," Elena said, though she couldn't help a small, envious smile. "I can't imagine Silas without a flintlock."

"He sent me a pic of a reconstructed charcoal grill. He looked... peaceful. It was disturbing."

"He's not the only one," Yusuf said quietly. The melancholy was creeping back into his voice. "Three people from my cohort have moved to 'lifestyle reconstructions' in the past year. No stakes. No danger. Just... comfort."

"Speaking of stakes," Elena said, "how does Mira keep all of this separate? The resort zones, the historical reconstructions, the—" she gestured vaguely toward the horizon, "—whatever else she has out there. The biosecurity alone must be a nightmare."

"It's a redundant stack," Kenji said. "Structural barriers first—deep-water trenches and ridge-lines that look like geography but act as hard containment. Then she layers in micro-climate thresholds. The reptiles hit a wall of dry, cool air and turn back by instinct."

"Reptiles?" Elena raised an eyebrow.

"Death adders," Yusuf said, with something like reverence. "Bred from lineages on Earth. Mira spent five years getting the venom yield right. They're part of the Lapita reconstruction—if you're walking the coastal paths at night without your glasses on high-alert, you're playing the same game the original settlers played."

"She built a sanctuary with actual venomous snakes."

"She built a *world* with actual consequences." Yusuf's voice was quiet. "That's the difference, Elena. In your sanctuary, the stakes are emotional. In Mira's, they're biological."

The synth-pop shifted to something slower. The golden light was beginning to deepen toward amber. Yusuf raised his glass, the neon-blue liquid catching the fading sun.

"To the death adders," he said. "May they never learn to read governance proposals."

Elena and Kenji raised their glasses. The clink of ice sounded sharp in the deepening quiet.

"Have you seen Mira?" Elena asked.

"No," Yusuf said. "Our host is 'deep in the zones.' There have been reported sightings in the 14th-century lagoon, but she's blocked all the public location logs." He paused, then gestured with the battered book, turning to a marked page. "She's letting us accumulate."

"Accumulate?"

"Like silt." He read from the page, his voice taking on a theatrical, mocking edge. "'Well-sorted aeolian deposits, Munsell number 10YR 6/4, light yellowish brown.'" He snorted and waved the book. "These guys dug by locus, by context number." His expression twisted into profound academic distaste. "Not by units the way God intended. I bet they believe method is theory-laden. Probably spent half their time debating the semiotics of a trowel."

"Yusuf," Kenji said gently.

Yusuf blinked, realizing he'd lost the thread. "Right. One by one, we arrive. We drink her gin. We argue about whether her 1950s surf club has the correct fat content in its burger patties—Lena and Raj are currently having that debate, by the way, with alarming intensity. And we wait for Mira to tell us if we're still archaeologists or if we're all about to become curators of 'sanitized nostalgia.'"

Elena watched the AI bartender mixing another drink. His movements were slightly hunched, a hint of fatigue in the shoulders. And there—she noticed it now—his fingernails were bitten, uneven, a little ragged. There was a tan line on his ring finger, like he'd recently removed a wedding band.

"The bartender," Elena said.

Kenji looked up. "What about him?"

"Mira gave him a failed marriage." She watched the AI wipe down the bar with practiced, weary motions. "Look at the way he moves. The fingernails. The ring tan. He's a background player in a beach resort, and she gave him a whole interior life that no visitor will ever ask about."

"That's Mira," Kenji said. "She can't help herself. I would have given him the mullet and called it a day."

"You wouldn't have given him anything," Yusuf said. "One of your AIs would have."

Kenji grinned impudently. "I don't understand the difference."

"I would have given him a story that *served* something," Elena said. "The failed marriage—what does it add to the visitor's experience? They'll never know."

"But *he* knows," Yusuf said quietly. "That's her point. The fidelity isn't for the visitor. It's for the truth."

They were silent for a moment, watching the bartender. The music played on.

Kenji let the silence hang for a beat, picking at a loose thread on his beach shirt. "Method *is* theory-laden, you know," he said finally, picking up a gauntlet Yusuf had dropped ages ago. "You can't measure the charge of an electron without the concept of an electron. The units we dig in aren't just boxes. They're questions we're asking the dirt."

Yusuf snorted into his drink but didn't argue. The admission—or at least the lack of rebuttal—felt like something.

The sun was setting—a perfect, reconstructed sunset that painted the beach in shades of coral and gold. The bartender wiped down his station and began preparing for the evening shift, his movements carrying the weight of a life that no one would ever ask about.

The sun had set. Above them, stars were emerging—too many, too bright, a sky that belonged to no decade Elena could name.

She looked up, then smiled slowly. "Echo," she said, pitching her voice for an audience. "Remind me to needle Mira about that starfield. It's too bright, too crowded for the late twentieth century." She paused for effect. "It's the only time I've ever seen her choose the view over the truth."

Kenji laughed. "Oh, she's going to *hate* that."

"She's going to say it's within acceptable parameters," Yusuf predicted. "Then she's going to spend three hours running variance calculations."

"Good," Elena said. "She deserves it."

They sat in comfortable silence, watching the wrong stars wheel overhead. It was the most beautiful mistake Elena had ever seen.
