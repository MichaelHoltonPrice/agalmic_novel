# The Gathering

The invitation had arrived that morning: coordinates, a dress code ("whatever you'd wear to a dig site in Samarkand"), and a note from Kenji: *We thought you might want to see what we never finished.*

Elena stepped through the threshold and stopped.

The caravanserai stretched before her—a courtyard of fired brick and carved stucco, the geometry unmistakably Central Asian. Silk banners hung from second-floor galleries in deep reds and golds. The air smelled of cumin and woodsmoke, and somewhere beyond the walls, she could hear the low complaint of camels.

A new message arrived from Kenji: "A draft. The buffalo ate the eastern wing." Elena laughed.

The courtyard was filling. She recognized faces from conferences, from collaborations, from decades of professional friction. Raj was examining the tilework with a jeweler's loupe. Lena was arguing with someone about the placement of a brazier. Others milled in clusters, drinks in hand, voices low.

And there, standing alone by the far colonnade, was Mira.

She looked tired. Not the productive exhaustion Elena knew from long sessions in the zones—this was something harder. Mira's shoulders were tight, her hands wrapped around a cup she wasn't drinking from. She was watching the room like a woman counting exits.

Their eyes met across the courtyard. Mira's expression flickered—something that might have been acknowledgment, or might have been warning—and then she turned away, disappearing into conversation with Raj.

Elena felt Kenji materialize at her elbow.

"She's been like that all evening," he murmured. "Braced for a fight."

"I should talk to her."

"You should." Kenji pressed a drink into her hand. "But maybe not yet. Let her settle. Let the room settle."

So Elena circled. She admired Lena's argument about the brazier placement. She listened to someone she half-recognized explain why the fountain's water pressure was slightly wrong for the period. She watched Mira move through the crowd—always visible, never close, the two of them orbiting each other like binary stars that could always dance, never touch.

Every time Elena considered approaching, Mira was already in conversation. Every time Mira glanced her way, Elena was examining tilework or laughing at something Yusuf said. The avoidance was so precise it had to be mutual.

An hour passed. The light in the courtyard shifted toward evening.

Then Kenji clapped his hands—the sound somehow carrying over every conversation—and announced that dinner was served.

---

The table was long and low, cushions arranged in the Central Asian style. Elena found herself seated near the center, with Yusuf on one side and an empty cushion on the other.

Mira took the empty cushion.

They sat in silence as the first dishes arrived—lamb and rice, flatbreads, small bowls of spiced yogurt. The conversation around them was lively, professional, full of the needling humor that marked their cohort. But between Elena and Mira, nothing.

It was Yusuf who broke the stalemate. He leaned across Elena to address Mira directly: "She almost stepped on one of your death adders yesterday."

Mira's head turned sharply. "What?"

"At the site. I had to grab her." Yusuf's voice was matter-of-fact. "She was about to put her foot right on it."

Elena felt Mira's attention shift to her—really shift, for the first time all evening. "You went to the site?"

"All morning." Elena kept her voice neutral. "Kenji showed me the potter. The young man with the scar."

Before Mira could respond, Lena's voice cut across the table from three seats down. "The site is exactly the problem, Mira. You know that."

Mira turned. Her expression didn't change, but Elena saw her shoulders tighten.

"The death adders," Lena continued, her tone reasonable, almost gentle. "The unfiltered pathogens. The containment protocols that are one system failure away from catastrophe. It's beautiful work. No one's saying otherwise. But the proposal exists because of sites like yours."

"The proposal exists because someone decided my methodology was inconvenient."

"The proposal exists because a visitors were injured and the network had to intervene." Lena set down her cup. "I'm not saying you're wrong to build what you build. I'm saying you could adapt. Accept the enhanced safety protocols. Keep your membership. Sanitize just enough to pass review."

"Sanitize." Mira's voice was flat.

"Compromise."

"You want me to remove the death adders."

"I want you to still be part of this network in six months." Lena leaned forward. "Half this table thinks you should have seen this coming and built differently from the start. The other half—" she gestured at herself, at the seats around her, "—we think you can still save it. But not if you treat every accommodation as a betrayal."

The table had gone quiet. Elena saw Kenji watching from across the room, his expression unreadable. Yusuf was studying his plate.

Mira was silent for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was controlled. "Is that what the rest of you think?"

The question opened the floor. Elena watched the table shift—glances exchanged, postures adjusted.

It was Raj who spoke next, his tone careful. "Lena's not wrong about the numbers, Mira. The smaller operators are voting yes because they want clarity. They're not trying to hurt you. They genuinely believe this makes the network better."

"Better for whom?"

"For everyone who doesn't want to explain to a grieving family why their loved one died in a reconstruction." Raj set down his cup. "I'm not saying you're careless. I'm saying the network has to think in aggregates. One death in your sanctuary becomes a question about every sanctuary."

Lena nodded. "It's not personal. It's structural."

"Structural." Mira's voice was flat.

Elena felt the weight of the moment. The table was waiting—not just for Mira's response, but for hers. *Your philosophy is the template.* The words she'd imagined Mira thinking all week. *Your name is all over this, even if they never wrote it down.*

"I think," Elena said slowly, "that I almost stepped on a death adder yesterday. Yusuf had to grab me." She turned to meet Mira's eyes. "Best moment I've had in weeks."

Mira blinked.

"I stood in your world, Mira. I watched your AI potter make the same pattern over and over while the young man next to her had a scar from something that actually happened. I felt the heat, and the danger, and what it meant to be somewhere that wasn't smoothed for my comfort." Elena took a breath. "Section 3.1 says 'no permissive tier.' That means no scars. No real consequences. No death adders. It means your site doesn't exist."

"I know what it means."

"I know you do." Elena didn't look away. "What you don't know is that I don't want my philosophy to be a weapon against yours. I never did. I didn't ask for this. And I'm not going to sit here and tell you to sanitize your life's work so someone else's liability model looks cleaner."

The silence stretched.

Raj shifted uncomfortably. Lena's expression was complicated—not hostile, but not convinced either.

"It's not about liability models," Lena said quietly. "It's about what we owe visitors."

"And what do we owe them?" Elena looked around the table. "Protection from every risk they've consented to? Comfort they didn't ask for?" She shook her head. "If Mira's approach gets defined out of existence, what's next? Yusuf's excavation ethics? Kenji's permissive navigation? How long before 'standardized wonder' means we're all building the same thing?"

No one answered.

Mira was watching her—really watching, for the first time all evening. Something in her expression had shifted. Not softened, exactly. But the woman counting exits had stopped counting.

"Kenji told me you were with us," Mira said finally. "Yusuf said you understood."

"They were right."

"I wanted to believe them."

"You should have." Elena allowed herself a small smile. "But I'm glad you made me say it out loud."

A long moment. Then Mira exhaled—a sound Elena hadn't realized she'd been waiting for.

"Alright," Mira said. "Alright."

Lena was quiet, her expression complicated. Elena couldn't tell if she was hurt, or relieved, or simply recalibrating.

Kenji raised his cup from across the table. "Are we done with the portion of the evening where everyone suspects everyone else of betrayal? Because this lamb is historically accurate and also delicious."

Mira took one of the drinks. "You built this in eighty-seven hours." It was a statement, not a question.

"My systems built it. I gave aesthetic direction." Kenji gestured at the banners. "Those are wrong, by the way. The red should be more madder, less cochineal. But we were working fast."

"It's beautiful."

"It's a draft." Kenji's voice softened. "We thought you might want to remember what we made together. Before everything got complicated."

Mira looked around the courtyard—at the tilework, the fountain, the silk banners that were wrong in ways only an expert would notice. "The buffalo problem," she said.

"Still unsolved."

"The herding patterns—"

"Completely fictional. Raj has been glaring at them for twenty minutes."

Something in Mira's face relaxed. Not completely—Elena suspected that would take days—but enough. "You built this for me."

"We built it for us." Kenji handed Elena the other drink. "All of us. Because we've spent thirty years arguing about methodology, and I thought we should remember that the arguments were never the point."

Yusuf's voice cut through the moment, characteristically grim. "The vote count is still climbing. Sixty-three percent support as of an hour ago."

"How long until the threshold?" Elena asked.

"Six hours. Maybe less." Yusuf's voice was flat. "We're not going to stop the initial vote. The smaller operators see this as a quality-of-life improvement. Standardized wonder, reduced liability. They don't understand what they're giving up, or they don't care. And maybe they shouldn't."

"Then we don't fight the initial vote," Elena said.

Mira looked at her sharply. "What?"

"We bypass it. We concede the legislative phase and pivot to the vetoes." Elena had been thinking about this during the ride over. "Yusuf, you said there's a rollback motion option?"

"Technically." Yusuf shook his head. "But the same operators who vote yes will vote against rollback. Probably."

"So what do you propose?" Lena's voice was sharp. "Fight the vetoes? Spend six months on a Guardian Appeal that goes nowhere?"

"I'm proposing we don't surrender before the fight starts."

"No one's surrendering." Raj looked up from his plate. "But Elena, you're talking about overriding a supermajority of operators. The smaller sanctuaries want this. They see it as a quality-of-life improvement. Are we really going to tell them they're wrong?"

"They're not wrong about what they want," Kenji said quietly. "They're wrong about what it costs."

"That's paternalistic."

"It's honest."

The argument fractured into smaller debates. Elena heard Henrik—three seats down, a voice she'd known for twenty years—say something about "liability exposure" and "responsible stewardship." Chen was nodding along. Raj was trying to find middle ground that didn't exist.

Mira had gone quiet, watching the table splinter.

Elena caught Kenji's eye. He gave a small nod toward the colonnade—*later.*

The evening wound down in fragments. The lamb grew cold. The arguments circled without resolving. One by one, guests made their excuses—early mornings, pending deadlines, the polite fictions that let people leave uncomfortable rooms.

By the time the courtyard was half-empty, Elena knew two things: the cohort was not united, and the people who mattered were.

Kenji found her by the fountain. "Tomorrow morning. Mira's receiving room. Anyone who wants to talk next steps."

"How many is that?"

"Hard to say." Kenji's expression was unreadable. "But more than I expected. I think people are finally ready to plan instead of argue."

Elena looked back at the caravanserai—the silk banners, the tilework, the draft of something they'd never finished. Tomorrow they would start something new.

She hoped they would finish it.
