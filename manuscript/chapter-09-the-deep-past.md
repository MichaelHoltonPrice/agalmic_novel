# Chapter 9: The Deep Past

## Elena

---

The transition to the Lapita site was not cushioned by twentieth-century nostalgia. There were no ceiling fans here, no Blue Hawaiis, no wrong stars to needle Mira about.

As Elena, Kenji, and Yusuf stepped out of the transit lock, the air hit them like a physical blow. It was thick with the smell of stagnant water, decaying vegetation, and the faint, sweet scent of fermented sago. The humidity was near-saturation. Within seconds, Elena's linen shirt—a relic of last night's beach resort—clung to her skin.

They stood on a narrow ridge overlooking a vast, swampy estuary. Below them, a cluster of thatched-roof structures sat on high stilts above the black, tea-colored water—the village. Outrigger canoes were tethered to the pilings, and smoke from several hearths curled upward through the heavy air.

"I'm no expert," Elena said, adjusting her glasses to filter the glare reflecting off the stagnant water, "but aren't the well-known Lapita sites on New Caledonia and the Solomons?" She paused. "Last night you toasted death adders, Yusuf, and I looked up their biogeographical distribution. They're on mainland New Guinea, but not New Caledonia or the Solomons. What gives?"

Yusuf's expression flickered—something complicated passing across his face before settling into studied neutrality. He didn't answer.

Kenji glanced at him, then stepped in smoothly. "What gives," he said, his eyes darting as his cortics overlaid archaeological schematics on the scene below, "is that Mira's filling in gaps. The Lapita were on the mainland—that's not particularly controversial. But the details of how they lived there, the specifics..." He shrugged. "There are sites that could have told us."

Elena looked between them. Kenji's tone was too careful. Yusuf was still staring at the village below.

"Wait," she said. "This is about the deferral debate? There was a proposed dig on mainland New Guinea?"

"Years ago," Kenji confirmed. "Yusuf led the ethics review."

Yusuf's voice was flat. "And voted to defer. Indefinitely."

Elena absorbed that. She knew the debate, of course—every boundary archaeologist did. Excavation was destructive; you only dug a site once. The question was whether to dig now or wait for better methods that would extract more from that single, irreversible act. The question had always existed. Accelerating technology just made it sharper.

But she hadn't known Yusuf had made *this* call. On relevant, mainland sites.

"And Mira wanted the data," she said.

"Mira wanted to *know*." Yusuf finally looked at her. "The decision was sound. She understood the reasoning. But understanding isn't the same as agreeing, and the gaps are still unfilled. So she built this—" he gestured at the swamp, the village, the sago palms, "—on inference instead of evidence. A 'what if' instead of a 'what was.'"

"She's been miffed ever since," Kenji added lightly.

"She's been *right* to be miffed." Yusuf's voice held no humor. "I made the call. I stand by the logic. But I also have to live with the fact that my caution is why she's guessing."

The silence stretched. Below them, the village went about its reconstructed morning, unaware of the weight pressing down on the ridge.

"The thatch," Kenji said finally, steering them back. "Look—she used sago palm fronds for the roofing, but the structural weave is still Bismarck-style. It's a jarring mix, if you're in on the joke."

"She's built a 'what if' out of sago and stilt-houses," he continued. "That's Mira for you—meticulous to a fault, but willing to stick out her tongue at the orthodoxy. Especially when the orthodoxy told her she couldn't have the data she wanted."

They descended the ridge, their feet sinking into dark, anaerobic muck. From deeper within the sago palm swamp, the rhythmic *thwack-thwack* of stone adzes echoed across the water—people working the pith in long, hollowed-out logs. Flies buzzed around them. Elena swatted a mosquito; her hand came away bloody.

"She hasn't pulled any punches with the biology," Elena noted, wiping a smear of dark muck and blood from her arm.

"She never does," Yusuf said. He was looking at his own hand, perhaps checking a readout on his palm or just considering the grit. "Mira thinks that as soon as you make the past comfortable, you've stopped doing boundary archaeology and started doing interior design."

"Boundary archaeology," Elena repeated. She glanced at Kenji. "You know, I still think about Luna sometimes. That first cohort meeting. Raj going on about 'experiential historiography,' Mira correcting his Polynesian terminology, Yusuf telling everyone our reconstructions were—"

"—epistemologically adventurous," Yusuf interjected.

"—guesses with better graphics." Elena smiled. "And then you stood up and said we were all standing at a cliff, and humanity had already jumped."

Kenji shrugged, suddenly interested in the village below. "I was pretentious."

"You named what we do," Elena said. "We sit at the boundary between the past and future. We're boundary archaeologists." She paused, swatting at a fly. "And now they're trying to standardize it."

Yusuf's voice was flat. "Have you actually read the proposal? The full text?"

"I've read the summary."

"Read Section 3.1. Consent Architecture." He spat the words like they tasted bad. "'There is no permissive tier. The network does not offer experiences where visitors consent to significant physical injury.'" He paused. "It's written in care-language—'clear expectations,' 'guaranteed safety'—but the effect is simple. Any sanctuary that offers permissive-tier experiences gets delisted. Any operator who allows genuine physical risk loses network membership."

"That's Mira," Elena said quietly. "That's her entire methodology."

"That's what I'm saying." Yusuf stopped walking, turning to face her. The humidity pressed down on all of them. "The proposal isn't about safety. It's about *type*. They're not banning danger; they're banning the *philosophy* that says danger can be meaningful. It's an insurance policy written by people who think the past was a mistake."

"And they're using me as the template," Elena said.

The words came out harder than she'd intended. Kenji and Yusuf both looked at her.

"Your design principles are quoted in the manifesto like axioms," Yusuf confirmed. "'Essential Experience.' 'Emotional depth with guaranteed safety.' They're not wrong that your sanctuaries are popular. They're not wrong that visitors are satisfied. But they've taken your *choice* and turned it into a *mandate*."

"I didn't ask for that."

"Of course not. But that's how capture works. They don't need your permission. They just need your precedent."

They walked in silence for a moment, the muck sucking at their feet. Elena thought about the manifesto, about seeing her own words reflected back at her in institutional language. It had felt wrong from the start—her choices hardened into requirements, her preferences turned into exclusions. A trap wearing her face.

They reached the edge of the village. A group of villagers—AI-driven, but their skin and movements indistinguishable from human—were working with clay, decorating pottery with the intricate, dentate-stamped patterns that were the signature of the Lapita culture.

Elena crouched to watch. The potter's hands moved with the patience of someone who had done this ten thousand times—pressing the dentate stamp into wet clay, rotating the vessel, pressing again. The rhythm was hypnotic. The flies didn't seem to bother her.

"You know what I keep thinking about?" Elena said, still watching. "The Silk Road project."

Kenji groaned. "The thirty-month argument?"

"The thirty-month argument." Elena smiled. "Yusuf spent six months on the camel genetics. Mira wanted the trade goods exactly right, which meant sourcing silk reconstructions from orbital labs. You wanted to build 'the emotional arc of exchange' without worrying about timeline. And I wanted it to *mean* something—which meant streamlining, which meant—"

"Which meant you were 'erasing the surplus,'" Yusuf finished. "I stand by that."

"I know you do. The buffalo tried to eat the caravansarai—"

"A minor technical hurdle," Kenji murmured.

"—and in the end, we couldn't make it work. Our philosophies were too different." She stood, wiping her hands on her already-ruined shirt. "But we kept *trying*. We kept arguing, failing, starting over. Because the discipline was big enough for all of us."

The potter looked up briefly, then returned to her work.

"Under the proposal," Elena said, "that's over. One philosophy. One standard. This—" she gestured at the swamp, the village, the heavy air, "—would be 'sanitized' out of existence."

They walked along the edge of the swamp in silence. The muck grabbed at Elena's boots with each step. Ahead, a young man was repairing an outrigger, his hands moving with a practiced, rhythmic grace. 

Elena stopped. There was a scar on his leg—a jagged line, coral-pink, the edges slightly raised. It looked like a coral scrape that had been allowed to heal naturally. No medical intervention. No accelerated recovery.

"That scar," she said quietly.

"It's a record," Yusuf said. "In Mira's world, you keep your scars. They're part of your biography." He paused. "In your world, they're healed within hours."

Elena didn't answer. She watched the young man work, his scarred leg braced against the outrigger's hull. The scar was part of him now—a story written in his skin, something he'd carry.

"Maybe you don't need permanent disfigurement to understand the Lapita people," Kenji said. His voice was unusually serious. "But without the *risk* of it—is it the same understanding?"

They stood in silence for a long moment, the heavy air pressing down on them. Elena looked across the black water toward the far side of the cylinder, where the horizon curved upward toward a world she couldn't see. Mira was out there somewhere, in the middle of this raw, uncompromising reality.

"She's not hiding," Elena realized. "She's working."

"She's always working," Yusuf said. He checked something—a readout, a notification—and his expression darkened. "And the proposal is at sixty-four percent."

The contrast between last night's beach resort and this raw, humid village felt like a physical weight. Elena realized that the "reunion" wasn't just about friendship. It was a comparative study. Mira had laid out her range—the resorts, the history, the risks—and left them to find their own way through it.

"We should head back," Kenji said, wiping sweat from his forehead. "The others will be gathering by now."

They turned toward the transit lock. Elena took a step—

Yusuf's hand shot out and caught her arm. "Don't."

She froze. Her foot hovered over a tangle of roots and leaf litter. 

"Back up," Yusuf said quietly. "Slowly."

She did. One step. Two. 

Then she saw it: a coil of dark scales, half-hidden in the debris. The head was triangular, the body thick and still. It hadn't moved. It didn't need to. 

A death adder. Maybe two feet from where her boot would have landed.

"If you'd stepped there," Kenji said, his voice strange, "and you weren't wearing your glasses on high-alert—"

"I know." Elena's heart was pounding. She could feel her pulse in her throat.

The snake slid away into the undergrowth, silent and unhurried. It didn't care about governance proposals or network standards. It was just there. Part of the record.

No one spoke until they reached the transit lock. The brushed steel felt cold against Elena's hand. Safe. Contained. Everything the swamp wasn't.

She looked back once, at the village and the black water and the world Mira had built.

And for the first time, she understood what they might lose.
