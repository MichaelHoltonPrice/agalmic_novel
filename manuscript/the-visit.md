# The Visit

## Solène

She knew what she was looking for. She just didn't know if it existed.

The transit pod released her into the arrival bay, and she stood for a moment in the threshold, letting the pressure equalize. Through the viewport, the cylinder's interior curved away in both directions—thirty kilometers of reconstructed American prairie, the grasses rippling under a wind she couldn't yet feel. The horizon bent upward at the edges, a reminder that this was a container, not a world. Most visitors stopped noticing after a few hours. She never did.

This was her seventh sanctuary in three months. She'd walked through the temple reconstructions at Angkor. She'd stood in a Florentine workshop while a behavioral model of Leonardo explained fresco technique. She'd felt the spray of simulated ocean in a dozen different enclaves. Each time, she'd felt something—admiration, sometimes awe, occasionally a sharp stab of beauty that took her breath away.

And each time, she'd left still searching.

The entry gate opened, and the prairie swallowed her whole.

The dust was the first thing she noticed. It tasted bitter, metallic, wrong in a way that felt *right*. Someone had thought carefully about this dust. Someone had calibrated it. For what, she wasn't yet sure, but she appreciated the craft. She always appreciated the craft.

The wagon trail stretched ahead, rutted and sun-baked, and she followed it because that's what visitors did. Her cortics fed her contextual information—dates, routes, mortality statistics—but she'd learned to dim that stream when she was in sanctuaries. The data interfered with whatever she was trying to feel. Or trying to fail to feel. She wasn't always sure which.

The trail was empty except for her. Most sanctuaries hosted multiple groups at once, but this one felt different—curated, personalized, like someone had designed it with attention for exactly who would walk through. She appreciated that. Or she would, if she could figure out what it was trying to give her.

An hour in, she reached a wagon that had been staged as aftermath.

The fire had burned down to embers. A family—NPCs, behavioral models, she could see the tells if she looked closely—was emerging from their tent, packing their belongings for another day's travel. Father checking the oxen. Mother wrapping flour in oilcloth. And a girl, maybe eight years old, coughing into her sleeve.

She stopped walking.

The girl's face was flushed. Her movements were slower than her parents'. She was sick—really sick, in the fiction of this place—and anyone paying attention could see where this was going. The parents didn't seem to notice yet. They were focused on the practical work of survival: the yokes, the flour, the endless preparation for a journey that ground you down one step at a time.

The girl looked up. She saw Solène watching. And she smiled.

It was a good smile. Procedurally generated, probably, but calibrated to feel authentic. The smile of a child who didn't know she was dying, or who knew and had decided to be brave about it. Solène's cortics could have told her which interpretation the designers intended. She didn't ask.

She felt something.

It took her a moment to identify it: admiration. For the construction. For the emotional engineering that had produced this moment—the careful staging of grief-to-come, the way the parents' obliviousness heightened the tragedy, the precise angle of morning light that made the girl's face glow like a Renaissance portrait.

She admired it. She recognized what it was doing to her. And in recognizing it, she stepped outside of it.

The exit was always there. She could leave right now—walk back to the entry gate, take a pod to the station, be home in a day. Nothing was stopping her. Nothing was at stake. The girl would die whether she watched or not, and her death would mean exactly what it was designed to mean, no more and no less.

But maybe that was unfair. Maybe she was asking the wrong thing of this place. It wasn't trying to put her in danger—it was trying to help her understand what danger had felt like for people who had no choice. That was a different goal. Maybe she should meet it on its own terms.

She had come here to feel something real. She was feeling something beautiful. Maybe she was the problem, not the sanctuary.

Later, she climbed a low rise to get a better view of the trail.

The landscape felt compressed somehow—too many biomes visible at once. She wondered if it was composite, and her cortics confirmed: Nebraska prairie bleeding into Wyoming foothills bleeding into Nevada alkali flats, a thousand miles compressed into thirty kilometers. The designers had prioritized emotional logic over cartographic accuracy. It worked, mostly. The sense of distance was real. The sense of exhaustion was real. The sense of hope-against-odds was real.

But the hope was borrowed. The exhaustion was optional. And she wasn't sure that was a flaw. Maybe it was just... different. Maybe she needed to stop comparing a curated experience to something it wasn't trying to be.

A woman stood on a rise across from her, maybe half a kilometer away. She was dressed in period clothing—wool trousers, rough-spun shirt, boots that had been aged to look like they'd walked a thousand miles. She seemed to be talking to the air, gesturing occasionally, her posture that of someone in conversation with an invisible partner.

She belonged here in a way Solène didn't. Not because of the costume—Solène could dress like that if she wanted—but because of how she *moved*. She wasn't visiting. She wasn't observing. She was *working*. This was her place. She had made it.

Solène didn't know who she was. She didn't approach. But she watched her for a while, trying to understand what it would feel like to care about something this much. To spend years calibrating dust, staging grief, building a world out of longing and bitter aftertaste.

It seemed exhausting. It seemed beautiful. It seemed like exactly the kind of devotion she'd never been able to muster for anything.

She left American Tapestry as the artificial sun began its programmed descent toward the habitat's axis.

The pod back to the station was quiet. Her cortics offered her satisfaction surveys, feedback forms, curated highlights from her visit. She dismissed them all. She didn't know how to rate an experience she couldn't quite name.

The sanctuary had been beautiful. The craft was undeniable. Whoever had built this place—the woman on the rise, or someone like her—had poured something genuine into it. She'd felt echoes of that genuineness everywhere she walked.

But echoes weren't the thing itself. Or maybe they were, and she just couldn't hear them right.

She'd been doing this for years now. Visiting sanctuaries. Hoping that this time, *this* time, something would catch. That the curated experience would somehow transmit what she was missing, that she'd find in these careful reconstructions whatever it was that her parents' generation had found in actual scarcity.

It hadn't happened yet. But she wasn't done looking. Lapita Horizons was next on her list—Pacific island lifeways, Mira Chen's place. Different culture, different methodology. Maybe that was what she needed. A change of scenery.

The question settled over her as the pod accelerated toward the transit station: *Was the problem the sanctuaries, or was the problem her?*

She didn't know yet. But she wasn't ready to stop looking.

Behind her, the cylinder grew smaller in the viewport, its prairie folding in on itself until it was just a bright sliver against the black. She had come here to feel something real. She'd felt something beautiful instead.

She wasn't sure what that meant. But she was going to find out.
