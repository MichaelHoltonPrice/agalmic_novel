# Chapter 8: The Gathering

## Elena

---

The transit pod's deceleration was gentle, the kind that fooled you into thinking you'd been stationary all along. Elena watched the viewport as Mira's habitat resolved itself—another rotating cylinder like her own, but as it filled the window, greens and blues washed over her instead of rustic hues. A different world entirely.

She stepped out into humidity and noted, professionally, how Mira had calibrated it—the salt-to-organic ratio in the air, the way the moisture settled without becoming oppressive. Good work. Different from her own environmental algorithms, but equally deliberate. Elena's prairie pulled moisture out; Mira's islands wrapped you in it. Both choices, both defensible.

"Elena?"

The voice startled her. She turned to see Kenji emerging from the path that led toward the visitor areas. He was dressed for the beach—loose linen shirt unbuttoned over swim trunks, bare feet leaving prints in the soft ground, a towel slung over one shoulder. Kenji Sato, whose Mesoamerican sanctuaries—Maya, Aztec, Olmec, and others—were among the most respected in the network, was clearly enjoying Mira's hospitality.

"Elena!" His face lit up. He pulled her into a hug before she could respond. "I didn't know you were coming."

"Kenji." She found herself smiling despite everything. His warmth was infectious. "What are you doing here?"

"Same as you, probably." He laughed—the same easy laugh that had always made methodological arguments feel more like conversations than battles. "I reached out to Mira after I saw the proposal. Turns out I wasn't the only one."

"How many?"

"I'm not sure. People have been arriving since yesterday. Some Mira contacted, some just showed up." He tilted his head, considering her. "You look like you need a drink. Come on—I know a place."

---

Like most boundary archaeologists, Mira had a range of themed sanctuaries within her habitat. Kenji led Elena past the Lapita village reconstructions, past taro fields and mangrove channels, until the environment shifted abruptly. The path opened onto a crescent of white sand, and Elena stopped.

A 1980s resort sprawled before her. Thatched-roof bungalows with ceiling fans turning lazily. Lounge chairs with bright striped cushions. A poolside bar where a bartender—AI-driven, but dressed in a Hawaiian shirt with period-appropriate hair—was already mixing something pink. From hidden speakers, synth-heavy pop drifted across the beach: Duran Duran, or something close.

"Mira made this?" Elena asked.

"Last year. She calls it 'The Tahitian Dream, 1987.' Apparently it was a real place—she found the architectural plans in some archive." Kenji was already walking toward the bar. "It's her guilty pleasure. Still faithful reconstruction, but the 1980s aren't exactly a challenge. And it's just... fun."

They settled into lounge chairs with piña coladas—served in actual coconut shells, neon paper umbrellas and all. The drink was cold and sweet and exactly right. Elena kicked off her boots and let her feet sink into warm sand. For a long moment, neither of them spoke.

"I've missed this," Kenji said finally. "Just... sitting with someone who gets it."

Elena nodded. The reconstructed sun was perfect—warm without burning, the light golden and slightly hazy in a way that said *late afternoon, tropical, no obligations*. She could feel her shoulders unknotting for the first time since she'd read the proposal.

"So," she said. "The manifesto—"

Kenji snorted and threw a handful of sand at her. It scattered across her legs, warm and fine-grained. Some got in her drink. She took a sip anyway.

"Hey!" she yelled, a little belated.

"There's time for that later." He signaled the bartender for another round. "Right now, you're going to tell me how the Morrison arc turned out. Last I heard, you were agonizing over whether the daughter's fever should break twice or three times."

Elena crunched a piece of ice, feeling the faint, mineral grit of the sand between her teeth. "Three times. It was the only way to get the pacing right. But I'm still getting flagged for 'excessive emotional friction' by the automated audits. Apparently, three fevers is a 'cognitive burden.'"

Kenji laughed, a deep sound that competed with the synth-pop. "Audits. They want us to build cathedrals but keep the ceiling height to code. I had a guy last month file a formal grievance because my Aztec ball court didn't have 'adequate seating for spectators with vertigo.' I told him the Aztecs didn't have tiered seating; you stood in the mud and hoped the gods liked you."

"Did you give in?"

"I gave him a physical support—a rough-hewn cedar beam that looked like a construction scaffold. It ruined the sightlines for the entire eastern quadrant, but at least he didn't fall over. He spent the whole match clutching it like a drowning man." Kenji leaned back, his eyes half-closed against the golden light. "But really, Elena. You look tired. Not 'two days in a transit pod' tired. More like 'carrying the weight of a tradition' tired."

"Is it that obvious?"

"To me? Yes. We’ve been comparing benchmarks since the Luna conference. Speaking of—did you hear about Silas? He finally quit the Colonial America project."

Elena sat up, nearly spilling the rest of her gritty piña colada. "Silas? He was the most stubborn guy in the network. What happened?"

"He moved to a 1950s suburbia sim. Says he wanted to work with lawns. 'Low stakes, high fidelity,' that was his quote. I think he just wanted to stop arguing about smallpox blankets and start arguing about the correct shade of lawn-green."

"Traitor," Elena said, though she couldn't help a small, envious smile. "I can't imagine Silas without a flintlock."

"He's happy. Sent me a pic of a reconstructed charcoal grill. He looked... peaceful. It was disturbing."

They lapsed into a comfortable silence, listening to the synthesized waves. The music shifted to something faster, a drum-machine beat that made Kenji tap his bare feet against the footrest. 

"I missed this," he said, and for a second the playfulness dropped away, replaced by the same vulnerability she'd felt when she first saw him. "The talk. The shop. The way we can sit here in a fake 1980s resort and talk about smallpox and ball-games and actually care about the difference."

"It's not a job," Elena said softly, "it's a vocation."

"Maybe." He paused. "Or maybe it's a way of being." He looked over at her, his expression uncharacteristically serious. "Either way, that's why we're all here, Elena. Because they're trying to make it a job. A standardized, predictable, auditable job."

He held her gaze for a moment, then blinked and gestured toward the bar. "But enough of that. Look at that bartender's hair. Is that a mullet? I think Mira programmed a mullet."

Elena followed his gaze and laughed. "It's definitely a mullet. And I think he's wearing actual aviator sunglasses. The commitment is terrifying."

"That's Mira. She can't help herself." Kenji stood up, brushing sand from his shorts. "I'm going to go see if he can make something called a 'Blue Hawaii.' It sounds like it should be illegal. Want one?"

"Only if it comes with another umbrella."

"Two umbrellas," Kenji promised, walking toward the bar with a skip in his step. "Minimum."

He came back with two glasses of a liquid so blue it looked like it should be used for cooling the superconducting magnets in a fusion reactor. Each was garnished with a slice of neon-red cherry, a wedge of pineapple, and three paper umbrellas of varying heights.

"To questionable aesthetic choices," Kenji said, handing her one.

Elena took a sip. It tasted like pineapple, coconut, and a type of sugar that had probably been banned in the 21st century. "It's... remarkably blue."

"It matches the horizon," Kenji said, gesturing to where the sky was deepening into a perfect, saturated indigo. "Mira's very thorough with her saturation levels."

They sat in the deepening twilight, the music shifting to a slower, more soulful beat—something about a diamond life. They talked about the people they missed, the ones who had moved on to building virtual sanctuarie or lived in the outer solar system and couldn't so easily visit. They talked about the time they'd tried to collaborate on a 'Silk Road meets American West' project that had collapsed under the weight of its own contradictions.

"Yusuf still says the camels were the problem," Kenji said, chuckling. "But we both know it was the buffalo."

"The buffalo were magnificent," Elena defended. "They just didn't like the elevation."

"A minor technical hurdle."

By the time the sun had fully set—replaced by a star-field that was too bright and too crowded for the 1980s, but which Mira had left in anyway—Elena felt a strange, fragile peace. The proposal was still a worry. But here, with the blue sugar and the synth-pop and one of her oldest friends, the world felt large again. Not just a string of governance notifications and audit logs.

"We should head back," Kenji said, standing up and brushing the last of the sand from his legs. "Mira's doing dinner. Apparently a lot of people showed up. Yusuf's already three drinks in, according to Mira."

---

The main pavilion was fuller than Elena had expected. Yusuf, wild-eyed and gesturing dramatically, was telling some story that had the others leaning in. Three others she recognized from network conferences: Raj from the African Savannahs, Lena from Viking Age reconstructions, and Tomas from the Industrial Revolutions. All colleagues she'd argued with, learned from, celebrated with over the years. All operators whose sanctuaries operated on the edge of what the proposal would permit.

They saw her and the room quieted, then filled with greetings—hugs, handshakes, the easy warmth of people who knew each other's work better than they knew each other's families. Yusuf swept her up in an embrace. "Elena! Finally, someone who understands why this matters."

She hadn't expected so many. But as she looked around the room—at the faces, at the way they moved toward her not with accusation but with recognition—she realized she shouldn't have been surprised. This wasn't just about Mira. This was about all of them. The proposal didn't just threaten Lapita Horizons; it threatened the very idea that sanctuaries could be different.

---

By evening, they gathered for dinner. The pavilion was strung with bioluminescent lanterns that cast a warm, amber glow over the table. Food arrived in waves—fresh-caught fish grilled over open flames, taro baked in leaves, fruits Elena couldn't name but whose juices stained her fingers. Wine flowed freely—bottles from Earth, from orbital vineyards, from sanctuaries that specialized in fermentation. Mira poured generously, her eyes sharp behind her glasses.

"To old arguments," Yusuf toasted, raising his glass. "And new fights."

They drank to that. The conversation started light—catching up on families, on recent reconstructions, on the absurdities of visitor expectations. But it didn't stay light. As the wine worked its way through them, the real talk began.

"It's not about safety," Raj said, his voice steady despite the three glasses he'd already drained. "Safety's an excuse. This is about control. About deciding what people should want."

Lena nodded. "My Vikings aren't safe either. Frostbite. Hypothermia. The raids—they can go wrong. But that's the point. The real Vikings didn't have safety protocols."

"Exactly," Mira said. "The proposal doesn't just prohibit harm. It prohibits the possibility of harm. That's different. That's saying certain experiences aren't allowed to exist."

Elena listened, turning her wine glass between her fingers. The group was leaning forward now, the laughter gone, replaced by the serious intensity of people who loved their work and saw it threatened.

"But Elena," Tomas said, turning to her. "Your sanctuary would be fine. You'd benefit from this. Why are you even here?"

The question hung in the air. She met his eyes, saw the genuine confusion there. "Because it's not about whether I benefit. It's about whether the network should be one way only."

Kenji leaned forward. "But practically speaking—what do we do? The approval timeline is compressed. Forty-five days. They moved fast enough that by the time we organize opposition, it'll be too late."

The group fell quiet. Wine glasses were refilled. Someone passed around a plate of grilled pineapple.

Elena thought about her father then—his stories of the pre-Convergence world, of how institutions moved faster than people could follow. *Capture-by-tempo*, he'd called it: the fastest process wins, then becomes the new normal. He'd smelled it in every "temporary measure" that became permanent, every rushed decision that locked in the future before anyone could object.

She set down her glass. "My father used to say it perfectly: capture-by-tempo. The fastest process wins, then becomes the new normal."

The others nodded slowly. Mira poured more wine. The conversation shifted to possibilities—what they might do, how they might respond—but the mood had changed. This wasn't just professional disagreement anymore. This was about defending something essential, about making sure the network didn't lose its diversity in a rush to standardize.

As the night wore on, the wine flowed and the arguments continued, Elena realized: this gathering wasn't just about the proposal. It was about them—the people who had chosen this strange vocation, who had dedicated their lives to helping others understand what it meant to be human in a world where survival was no longer at stake. They disagreed about everything. They respected each other completely.

And now they were all in danger of losing what they loved.
