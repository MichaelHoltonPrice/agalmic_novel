# Chapter 3: The Incident

## Solène

---

The humidity hits me before I've cleared the entry gate.

It's not like the dry heat of the prairie—that was honest, extractive, a heat that pulled moisture from your skin and left you knowing you'd been touched. This is different. The air here has weight. It settles on my shoulders like a warm, wet cloth and doesn't lift. Within minutes, my clothes cling. Within hours, I stop noticing. This is simply how air works now.

Lapita Horizons doesn't announce itself the way American Tapestry did. No vista, no curated horizon line. Instead: a path through coastal scrub, the ground soft with decomposing leaves, and somewhere ahead the sound of waves I can't yet see. The light is different—filtered green through pandanus fronds, dappled and restless. My feet sink slightly with each step. Reef-sand mixed with dark organic soil, nothing like the alkaline grit that worked into my boots on the prairie.

I smell the ocean before I see it. Salt and iodine, yes, but also something richer—mud and brine layered together, the particular funk of mangroves where the tidal line blurs the boundary between land and sea. It's not a clean smell. It's a living smell. Things are growing here, and things are rotting, and the distinction doesn't seem to matter much.

A crab scuttles across the path ahead of me. Bright orange, one pincer absurdly larger than the other, held up like a boxer's guard. It watches me with stalked eyes, then disappears sideways into the undergrowth. I realize I'm smiling.

The intake process is different here.

At American Tapestry, the consent forms were thorough but routine—emotional intensity, historical content, the standard acknowledgments. Here, Mira Chen's sanctuary offers something else. A fork in the path. A choice.

"Safe-tier gives you the full sensory experience," the intake system explains. "You'll feel fatigue, weather exposure, muscle strain. But injury is prevented. Recovery resources are always available. Most visitors choose this option."

"And permissive-tier?"

A pause. Not processing—deliberate. "Permissive-tier removes most intervention protocols. Physical injury is possible. The habitat will not soften consequences for you. Medical extraction occurs only for immediately life-threatening situations."

"What counts as life-threatening?"

"That determination is made by network safety systems, not by you. This is non-negotiable."

I sign for permissive-tier. My signature feels like the first real thing I've done in months.

---

The first day, I learn what labor means.

We go into the swamp to find sago. Not a designated processing area, not a workstation—the swamp itself, where the palms grow in standing water and the mud sucks at your ankles with every step. The work is women's work here, a reconstruction speculative but grounded in comparative ethnography. The sanctuary doesn't pretend to certainty. It offers a possibility, honestly framed, and invites you to inhabit it.

Finding the right tree is a skill I don't have. The woman leading our group—an NPC, I assume, though she feels startlingly real—shows me how to bore into the trunk with a hand tool, how to taste the pith and read its texture. Too wet, too dry, not enough starch—we pass three trees before she finds one ready for harvest. She doesn't explain her criteria in words I understand. She just knows, the way someone knows after a lifetime of this work, and I'm left to watch and guess and feel useless.

Then the pounding begins. We'll work this tree for three days, breaking down the pith, washing the starch, collecting it in troughs made from palm bark. The technique looks simple: rhythmic strikes, steady pressure, let the fibers separate. After an hour, my shoulders burn. After three hours, my arms shake with every stroke. The woman maintains a pace I can't match. Her strokes are efficient, almost musical. Mine are ragged, desperate, wrong.

She doesn't offer help. She doesn't tell me to slow down. She just keeps working, and after a while I realize that's the lesson: the work doesn't care if I'm ready for it. The work simply is.

We leave some pith behind when we finish. "Come back later," she says, "and there will be grubs." She mimes eating, grinning. I can't tell if she's joking.

That night, back at the village, I eat roasted bananas around a fire while someone shapes sago dough into clay molds for baking. The smell of the bananas is extraordinary—caramelized sugar and smoke and something almost floral underneath. The taste is better. Sweet and dense, the flesh yielding against my teeth. I eat three of them, burning my fingers on the skins, and no one tells me to slow down. The sago bread comes out of the fire later, dense and slightly acrid, and I eat that too.

Walking back to the sleeping shelter in the dark, I feel something crunch under my foot. I freeze. My cortics, dimmed but not silent, whisper: *scorpion, non-lethal species, reconstructed for period accuracy*. But my body doesn't care about accuracy. My heart pounds. I stand very still for a long moment, feeling the darkness press in, before I can make myself move again.

This is what I came for. This is what I've been missing.

---

The days blur.

I learn to read clouds for approaching weather—not because a tutorial tells me to, but because getting caught in a squall while reef-fishing means hours of shivering afterward, and the habitat doesn't warm you. I learn which paths to avoid after dark because of the centipedes—massive things that hiss when disturbed, their bodies glistening in the firelight when someone accidentally kicks one near the cooking area. I learn the particular tension of knowing there are death adders in the underbrush, and that the sanctuary has reconstructed them faithfully, venom and all.

My shoulders harden from the pounding. My skin darkens with sun the habitat doesn't filter. I lose track of which day it is, and the loss feels like a gift.

On the fourth morning—or maybe the fifth—I wake before dawn and walk to the taro gardens alone. The mud sucks at my feet. The air smells of green growth and salt. Somewhere in the distance, someone is singing, the melody unfamiliar but the emotion unmistakable: work music, rhythm for labor, the kind of song that makes repetitive motion bearable.

I catch fragments as I walk closer. *Rumaq i tanoq... rumaq i saqat...* The words are reconstructed Proto-Oceanic, the sanctuary's best guess at what Lapita speech might have sounded like—*rumaq* meaning something broader than house, more like the place where a people belongs, the community that holds you. *Rumaq i tanoq*, the home in the earth. *Rumaq i saqat*, the home in the sea. The song seems to be about both, about a people who lived between.

I stand there watching light seep into the sky and realize I'm not thinking about anything at all. Not analyzing. Not comparing. Not asking whether this experience is authentic or constructed, whether I'm a tourist in someone else's suffering, whether the exit is always there.

The exit is always there. But for the first time, I don't want to take it.

The coconut palms grow at the edge of the village clearing, their trunks curving toward the light.

I've watched others climb them—the technique is specific, a rhythm of grip and push, bare feet braced against rough bark, the body inching upward in controlled lurches. It looks difficult. It is difficult. But by now I've learned that difficult is just another word for *real*, and real is what I came here to find.

The trunk is rougher than I expected. The bark scrapes my inner thighs, my forearms, the soft pads of my palms that have only just healed from the pounding. I'm twenty feet up when I feel the rhythm fail—my right foot slips, my grip compensates badly, and suddenly I'm not climbing anymore. I'm falling.

The ground comes up fast.

I land wrong. My ankle folds beneath me, a bright crack of pain that whites out thought. For a moment I just lie there, breath knocked out, the sky wheeling overhead through the palm fronds. Then the pain resolves itself into specifics: ankle, definitely broken; hip, bruised but functional; palms, scraped raw again, bleeding into the dirt.

I laugh. I don't know why. But I'm lying in the mud with a broken bone and I'm *laughing*, because for the first time in my life something has actually happened to me. Something with consequences. Something that won't just heal in an hour because the network decided I'd had enough.

The woman from the swamp—the one who taught me to test the trees—appears above me. She looks down at my ankle—already swelling, visibly wrong—and her face is unreadable.

"Can you stand?"

"I don't think so."

She nods. Kneels beside me. Begins to assess the damage with practiced hands, and I realize she's not an NPC at all. She's a sanctuary operator, Mira's staff, and she's been watching me this whole time.

"You signed permissive," she says. It's not a question.

"Yes."

"The bone is broken. Recovery will take weeks without intervention. You can continue the experience with limited mobility, or—"

"I want to continue."

She looks at me for a long moment. I see something in her face—respect, maybe, or recognition. The look of someone who understands what I'm asking for and doesn't think I'm wrong to ask.

"I'll splint it," she says. "Traditional materials. It's going to hurt."

"Good."

---

She's fitting the splint—bamboo strips, plant-fiber binding, every touch sending sharp jolts through my nervous system—when we hear the sound.

A low drone, mechanical, wrong. It doesn't belong here. The sanctuary's soundscape is waves and wind and bird calls and human voices; this is something else entirely. We both look up.

The aircraft is small, white, clinical—a medical extraction drone, descending toward the clearing with the unhurried precision of a system that knows it cannot be refused. The operator's hands go still on the splint. Her expression changes. Not anger. Something worse: resignation.

"Network intervention," she says quietly. "I'm sorry."

"What? No. I signed—"

"The system flagged your injury as requiring extraction. I don't have authority to override." She's already standing, stepping back, making room for the drone to land. Her body language says she's done this before. Her face says she hates it every time.

"I consented to this," I say. The drone settles onto the ground ten meters away, its rotors winding down, a hatch sliding open to reveal a sterile medical bay inside. "I signed the agreement. The injury isn't life-threatening—"

"Network policy supersedes permissive-tier consent for certain injury categories. Compound fractures, infection risk, anything requiring more than field treatment." She won't meet my eyes. "I argued against this protocol when they implemented it. I lost."

Two figures emerge from the drone—not human, or not entirely, their movements too smooth, their faces too calm. Medical technicians, AI-driven or heavily augmented, I can't tell and it doesn't matter. They're already walking toward me with a stretcher.

"You can't—" But they can. The network can. The system doesn't care what I signed or what I wanted or whether I was finally, *finally*, feeling something real. The system has decided that my choices were wrong, that I need to be protected from myself, and now the technicians are lifting me onto the stretcher and the operator is standing at the edge of the clearing watching me go and the last thing I see before they carry me into the drone is her face.

She's not looking at me anymore. She's looking at the ground, at the blood and mud where I was lying, and her expression is one I'll remember for years.

Shame. Not hers. The system's.

---

I'm healed in less than two hours.

The medical systems are efficient, thorough, kind. My ankle rebuilds itself while I lie in a sterile pod and watch readouts I don't understand. A calm voice explains the procedure, offers me water, asks if I'm comfortable. Everything about the experience is designed to reassure me that I'm cared for, that the network has my best interests at heart, that this was all for my own good.

I don't speak. I don't answer the survey questions. When they release me, I walk out on two perfect ankles and feel nothing at all.

The flatness is back. Worse than before. Because now I know what it felt like to be present, and I know they took it from me, and I know they'll do it to anyone else who gets too close to something real.

I signed for risk. I understood the consequences. I *wanted* the consequences.

They decided for me that I couldn't.

On the transport back to Earth, I start writing.

I don't know yet that it will go viral. I don't know that thousands of people will message me saying *you said what I've been feeling*. I don't know that I'm about to become the public face of a movement I never intended to start.

I just know that the sanctuaries aren't what they pretend to be. They're not spaces for growth or understanding or authentic experience. They're cages dressed as playgrounds, and the door only looks unlocked. The moment you try to stay—the moment the stakes become real—they drag you back out and heal you whether you like it or not.

The network calls this protection. The network calls this care.

I have another word for it. I just haven't found it yet.

But I will.
