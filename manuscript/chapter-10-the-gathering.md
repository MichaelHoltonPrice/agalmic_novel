# Chapter 10: The Gathering

The invitation had arrived that morning: coordinates, a dress code ("whatever you'd wear to a dig site in Samarkand"), and a note from Kenji: *We thought you might want to see what we never finished.*

Elena stepped through the threshold and stopped.

The caravanserai stretched before her—a courtyard of fired brick and carved stucco, the geometry unmistakably Central Asian. Silk banners hung from second-floor galleries in deep reds and golds. The air smelled of cumin and woodsmoke, and somewhere beyond the walls, she could hear the low complaint of camels.

"Eighty-seven hours," Echo said quietly. "Kenji's systems built this from the original survey data. The structural math was already solved; they just needed to paint."

Elena walked slowly toward the central fountain. The water was real—she could feel the mist on her face. The tiles beneath her feet were worn in the patterns of ten thousand travelers.

"This is what we would have made," she said.

"A draft. Kenji's note said to tell you: 'The buffalo ate the eastern wing. We never solved the herding patterns.'"

She laughed, remembering. Thirty months of argument, and in the end they'd shelved the project because none of them could agree on whether Sogdian merchants would have tolerated the smell.

The courtyard was filling. She recognized faces from conferences, from collaborations, from decades of professional friction. Raj was examining the tilework with a jeweler's loupe. Lena was arguing with someone about the placement of a brazier. Others milled in clusters, drinks in hand, voices low.

And there, standing alone by the far colonnade, was Mira.

She looked tired. Not the productive exhaustion Elena knew from long sessions in the zones—this was something harder. Mira's shoulders were tight, her hands wrapped around a cup she wasn't drinking from. She was watching the room like a woman counting exits.

Their eyes met across the courtyard. Mira's expression flickered—something that might have been acknowledgment, or might have been warning—and then she turned away, disappearing into conversation with Raj.

Elena felt Kenji materialize at her elbow.

"She's been like that all evening," he murmured. "Braced for a fight."

"I should talk to her."

"You should." Kenji pressed a drink into her hand. "But maybe not yet. Let her settle. Let the room settle."

So Elena circled. She admired Lena's argument about the brazier placement. She listened to someone she half-recognized explain why the fountain's water pressure was slightly wrong for the period. She watched Mira move through the crowd—always visible, never close, the two of them orbiting each other like binary stars that had forgotten how to touch.

Every time Elena considered approaching, Mira was already in conversation. Every time Mira glanced her way, Elena was examining tilework or laughing at something Yusuf said. The avoidance was so precise it had to be mutual.

An hour passed. The light in the courtyard shifted toward evening.

Then Kenji clapped his hands—the sound somehow carrying over every conversation—and announced that dinner was served.

---

The table was long and low, cushions arranged in the Central Asian style. Elena found herself seated near the center, with Yusuf on one side and an empty cushion on the other.

Mira took the empty cushion.

They sat in silence as the first dishes arrived—lamb and rice, flatbreads, small bowls of spiced yogurt. The conversation around them was lively, professional, full of the needling humor that marked their cohort. But between Elena and Mira, nothing.

It was Yusuf who broke the stalemate. He leaned across Elena to address Mira directly: "She almost stepped on one of your death adders yesterday."

Mira's head turned sharply. "What?"

"At the site. I had to grab her." Yusuf's voice was matter-of-fact. "She was about to put her foot right on it."

Elena felt Mira's attention shift to her—really shift, for the first time all evening. "You went to the site?"

"All morning." Elena kept her voice neutral, matching Mira's earlier tone. "Kenji showed me the potter. The young man with the scar."

"And?"

"And I stood in your world." Elena turned to meet Mira's eyes. "I understand what they're trying to take."

The table noise seemed to recede. Around them, the others kept eating, kept talking, but Elena was aware only of the space between herself and Mira—the years of friendship, the weeks of silence, the weight of everything unsaid.

"Do you." Mira's voice was flat.

It wasn't a question. Elena heard what was underneath it: *Your philosophy is the template. Your name is all over this, even if they never wrote it down.*

"I didn't ask for this," Elena said quietly. "And I don't want it."

"That's easy to say."

"I know."

Mira set down her bread. Her hands were steady, but something in her jaw was tight. "Lena thinks I should compromise. Accept the 'enhanced safety protocols' and keep my membership. Sanitize the site just enough to pass review."

"Is that what you want?"

"It's what half this table thinks I should do." Mira's gesture took in the room. "The other half thinks I should have seen this coming and built differently from the start."

"And what do *you* think?"

The question hung in the air. Around them, Elena noticed the conversations had grown quieter. Others were listening now—not obviously, but the table had turned in their direction.

"I think," Mira said slowly, "that I've spent three days waiting for you to tell me you support it."

Elena felt the words land. "Mira—"

"Your philosophy. Your approach. Everything I do is the thing they're trying to eliminate, and everything you do is the thing they're trying to mandate." Mira's voice was low but steady. "I kept waiting for you to say it made sense. That the network needed to choose. That my way was just... too much."

"No."

"No?"

"No." Elena didn't look away. "I read Section 3.1. I saw what 'no permissive tier' means. I watched your AI potter make the same pattern over and over while her neighbor has a scar from something that actually happened." She took a breath. "I don't want my philosophy to be a weapon against yours. I never did."

The table was silent now. Everyone was listening.

Mira studied her face. Elena let herself be studied—by Mira, by Kenji, by Yusuf, by the whole cohort watching this unfold. Whatever she said next would be on the record.

"Kenji told me you were with us," Mira said finally. "Yusuf said you understood. I wanted to believe them."

"You should have."

"I'm careful about what I believe."

"I know." Elena allowed herself a small smile. "That's why you're good at this."

A long moment. Then Mira exhaled—a sound Elena hadn't realized she'd been waiting for.

"Alright," Mira said. "Alright."

Kenji raised his cup. "Are we done with the portion of the evening where everyone suspects everyone else of betrayal? Because this lamb is historically accurate and also delicious."

Mira took one of the drinks. "You built this in eighty-seven hours."

"My systems built it. I gave aesthetic direction." Kenji gestured at the banners. "Those are wrong, by the way. The red should be more madder, less cochineal. But we were working fast."

"It's beautiful."

"It's a draft." Kenji's voice softened. "We thought you might want to remember what we made together. Before everything got complicated."

Mira looked around the courtyard—at the tilework, the fountain, the silk banners that were wrong in ways only an expert would notice. "The buffalo problem," she said.

"Still unsolved."

"The herding patterns—"

"Completely fictional. Raj has been glaring at them for twenty minutes."

Something in Mira's face relaxed. Not completely—Elena suspected that would take days—but enough. "You built this for me."

"We built it for us." Kenji handed Elena the other drink. "All of us. Because we've spent thirty years arguing about methodology, and I thought we should remember that the arguments were never the point."

Yusuf joined them, his expression characteristically grim. "The vote count is still climbing. Sixty-three percent support as of an hour ago."

"How long until the threshold?" Elena asked.

"Two days. Maybe less." Yusuf's voice was flat. "We're not going to stop the initial vote. The smaller operators see this as a quality-of-life improvement. Standardized wonder, reduced liability. They don't understand what they're giving up."

"Then we don't fight the initial vote," Elena said.

Mira looked at her sharply. "What?"

"We bypass it. We concede the legislative phase and pivot to the vetoes." Elena had been thinking about this since the death adder. Since the scar. "Yusuf, you said there's a rollback motion option?"

"Technically." Yusuf shook his head. "But the same operators who vote yes will vote against rollback. The numbers don't change."

"Then we skip it. We go straight to the vetoes." Elena looked at each of them in turn. "Guardian Triad. User Veto. Institutional influence."

"Divide and conquer," Kenji said.

"Divide and coordinate." Elena turned to Mira. "The Guardian Appeal is your strongest ground. You can make the case for pluralism better than any of us."

"And if they say no?"

"Then we escalate." Elena paused. "But I don't think they will. The Contemporary Trust guardian is sensitive to paternalism. The Legacy guardian remembers how temporary measures become permanent. If we frame this right—"

"If we frame this right, we're still asking them to override a supermajority of operators," Yusuf said. "That's politically expensive."

"Which is why we need the User Veto as backup." Elena looked at Kenji. "Your systems. Your reach. Can you help me build a campaign?"

Kenji's expression shifted—the joviality dropping away to reveal something sharper underneath. "I've been modeling the attention problem. Most users don't care about governance. They care about their next experience. We need something that cuts through."

"What?"

"I don't know yet." Kenji's eyes were distant, already calculating. "But I'll find it."

"And institutional influence?" Mira asked.

"That's me." Elena felt the weight of it settle onto her shoulders. "I have connections in the Operating Company. People who respect what we've built. I can try to get the Executive to pause, to reconsider—"

"The Executive wrote the manifesto," Yusuf said. "He believes in this."

"I know." Elena remembered the clinical language of Section 3.1. "But he also believes in process. If we can show him the process was captured—the compressed timeline, the consent friction adjustments—he might listen."

"Or he might dismiss us as academics clinging to privilege."

"He might." Elena met Yusuf's eyes. "But we have to try."

The courtyard was quieter now. The other guests had drifted into their own conversations, their own debates. Elena could see Raj still arguing about the brazier placement, could hear Lena's voice rising in defense of some methodological point.

"There's something else," Mira said quietly. "Henrik. And possibly Chen."

"What about them?"

Mira's expression was carefully neutral. "They support the proposal. Genuinely. Henrik thinks permissive-tier experiences are irresponsible—he's been saying so for years. Chen believes standardization will legitimize the discipline, make it easier to defend against critics."

"They're wrong," Elena said.

"They're sincere." Mira's voice was flat. "They're our colleagues, and they want the proposal to pass."

The silence stretched. Somewhere beyond the walls, a camel made a sound of complaint.

"Then we convince them," Elena said finally. "Or we work around them. But we don't let their sincerity stop us from fighting for what's right."

Yusuf raised his cup. "To the death adders."

Kenji raised his. "To the buffalo we never herded."

Elena raised hers. "To thirty years of arguments."

Mira hesitated. Then she lifted her cup to meet theirs. "To finishing what we started."

They drank. The courtyard glowed in the evening light, silk banners moving in a breeze that Kenji's systems had calibrated for authenticity. Somewhere in the distance, the camels settled into silence.

Elena looked at her friends—her colleagues, her rivals, her cohort. They had spent three decades needling each other about methodology, about philosophy, about whether the computer could ever replace the trowel. They had argued about everything.

And now, finally, they were on the same page.

"So," Kenji said, breaking the silence. "Who wants to hear about the herding patterns I made up?"

"They're terrible," Raj called from across the courtyard. "Completely ahistorical."

"That's the point." Kenji grinned. "It's a draft. We're allowed to be wrong."

Mira shook her head, but she was almost smiling. "You're impossible."

"I'm consistent." Kenji spread his hands. "I've been impossible for thirty years. You should be used to it by now."

Elena watched them settle into the old rhythms—the needling, the affection, the professional friction that had somehow become the foundation of everything they'd built together. The proposal was still climbing toward passage. The fight was just beginning.

But for the first time since the notification arrived, she felt something like hope.

Not certainty. Never certainty. But hope.

It would have to be enough.
