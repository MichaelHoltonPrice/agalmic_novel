# The Incident

## Solène

---

The humidity hit her before she'd cleared the entry gate.

It wasn't like the dry heat of the prairie—that had been honest, extractive, a heat that pulled moisture from your skin and left you knowing you'd been touched. This was different. The air here had weight. It settled on her shoulders like a warm, wet cloth and didn't lift. Within minutes, her clothes clung. Within hours, she stopped noticing. This was simply how air worked now.

Lapita Horizons didn't announce itself the way American Tapestry had. No vista, no curated horizon line. Instead: a path through coastal scrub, the ground soft with decomposing leaves, and somewhere ahead the sound of waves she couldn't yet see. The light was different—filtered green through pandanus fronds, dappled and restless. Her feet sank slightly with each step. Reef-sand mixed with dark organic soil, nothing like the alkaline grit that had worked into her boots on the prairie.

She smelled the ocean before she saw it. Salt and iodine, yes, but also something richer—mud and brine layered together, the particular funk of mangroves where the tidal line blurred the boundary between land and sea. It wasn't a clean smell. It was a living smell. Things were growing here, and things were rotting, and the distinction didn't seem to matter much.

A crab scuttled across the path ahead of her. Bright orange, one pincer absurdly larger than the other, held up like a boxer's guard. It watched her with stalked eyes, then disappeared sideways into the undergrowth. She realized she was smiling.

The intake process was different here.

At American Tapestry, the consent forms had been thorough but routine—emotional intensity, historical content, the standard acknowledgments. Here, Mira Chen's sanctuary offered something else. A fork in the path. A choice.

"Safe-tier gives you the full sensory experience," the intake system explained. "You'll feel fatigue, weather exposure, muscle strain. But injury is prevented. Recovery resources are always available. Most visitors choose this option."

"And permissive-tier?"

A pause. Not processing—deliberate. "Permissive-tier removes most intervention protocols. Physical injury is possible. The habitat will not soften consequences for you. Medical extraction occurs only for immediately life-threatening situations."

"What counts as life-threatening?"

"That determination is made by network safety systems, not by you. This is non-negotiable."

She signed for permissive-tier. Her signature felt like the first real thing she'd done in months.

The first day, she learned what labor meant.

They went into the swamp to find sago. Not a designated processing area, not a workstation—the swamp itself, where the palms grew in standing water and the mud sucked at your ankles with every step. The work was women's work here, a reconstruction speculative but grounded in comparative ethnography. The sanctuary didn't pretend to certainty. It offered a possibility, honestly framed, and invited you to inhabit it.

Finding the right tree was a skill she didn't have. The woman leading their group—an NPC, she assumed, though she felt startlingly real—showed her how to bore into the trunk with a hand tool, how to taste the pith and read its texture. Too wet, too dry, not enough starch—they passed three trees before she found one ready for harvest. She didn't explain her criteria in words Solène understood. She just knew, the way someone knew after a lifetime of this work, and Solène was left to watch and guess and feel useless.

Then the pounding began. They'd work this tree for three days, breaking down the pith, washing the starch, collecting it in troughs made from palm bark. The technique looked simple: rhythmic strikes, steady pressure, let the fibers separate. After an hour, Solène's shoulders burned. After three hours, her arms shook with every stroke. The woman maintained a pace she couldn't match. Her strokes were efficient, almost musical. Solène's were ragged, desperate, wrong.

She didn't offer help. She didn't tell Solène to slow down. She just kept working, and after a while Solène realized that was the lesson: the work didn't care if she was ready for it. The work simply was.

They left some pith behind when they finished. "Come back later," the woman said, "and there will be grubs." She mimed eating, grinning. Solène couldn't tell if she was joking.

That night, back at the village, she ate roasted bananas around a fire while someone shaped sago dough into clay molds for baking. The smell of the bananas was extraordinary—caramelized sugar and smoke and something almost floral underneath. The taste was better. Sweet and dense, the flesh yielding against her teeth. She ate three of them, burning her fingers on the skins, and no one told her to slow down. The sago bread came out of the fire later, dense and slightly acrid, and she ate that too.

Walking back to the sleeping shelter in the dark, she felt something crunch under her foot. She froze. Her cortics, dimmed but not silent, whispered: *scorpion, non-lethal species, reconstructed for period accuracy*. But her body didn't care about accuracy. Her heart pounded. She stood very still for a long moment, feeling the darkness press in, before she could make herself move again.

This was what she'd come for. This was what she'd been missing.

The days blurred.

She learned to read clouds for approaching weather—not because a tutorial told her to, but because getting caught in a squall while reef-fishing meant hours of shivering afterward, and the habitat didn't warm you. She learned which paths to avoid after dark because of the centipedes—massive things that hissed when disturbed, their bodies glistening in the firelight when someone accidentally kicked one near the cooking area. She learned the particular tension of knowing there were death adders in the underbrush, and that the sanctuary had reconstructed them faithfully, venom and all.

Her shoulders hardened from the pounding. Her skin darkened with sun the habitat didn't filter. She lost track of which day it was, and the loss felt like a gift.

On the fourth morning—or maybe the fifth—she woke before dawn and walked to the taro gardens alone. The mud sucked at her feet. The air smelled of green growth and salt. Somewhere in the distance, someone was singing, the melody unfamiliar but the emotion unmistakable: work music, rhythm for labor, the kind of song that made repetitive motion bearable.

She caught fragments as she walked closer. *Rumaq i tanoq... rumaq i saqat...* The words were reconstructed Proto-Oceanic, the sanctuary's best guess at what Lapita speech might have sounded like—*rumaq* meaning something broader than house, more like the place where a people belongs, the community that holds you. *Rumaq i tanoq*, the home in the earth. *Rumaq i saqat*, the home in the sea. The song seemed to be about both, about a people who lived between.

She stood there watching light seep into the sky and realized she wasn't thinking about anything at all. Not analyzing. Not comparing. Not asking whether this experience was authentic or constructed, whether she was a tourist in someone else's suffering, whether the exit was always there.

The exit was always there. But for the first time, she didn't want to take it.

The coconut palms grew at the edge of the village clearing, their trunks curving toward the light.

She'd watched others climb them—the technique was specific, a rhythm of grip and push, bare feet braced against rough bark, the body inching upward in controlled lurches. It looked difficult. It was difficult. But by now she'd learned that difficult was just another word for *real*, and real was what she'd come here to find.

The trunk was rougher than she'd expected. The bark scraped her inner thighs, her forearms, the soft pads of her palms that had only just healed from the pounding. She was twenty feet up when she felt the rhythm fail—her right foot slipped, her grip compensated badly, and suddenly she wasn't climbing anymore. She was falling.

The ground came up fast.

She landed wrong. Her ankle folded beneath her, a bright crack of pain that whited out thought. For a moment she just lay there, breath knocked out, the sky wheeling overhead through the palm fronds. Then the pain resolved itself into specifics: ankle, definitely broken; hip, bruised but functional; palms, scraped raw again, bleeding into the dirt.

She laughed. She didn't know why. But she was lying in the mud with a broken bone and she was *laughing*, because for the first time in her life something had actually happened to her. Something with consequences. Something that wouldn't just heal in an hour because the network had decided she'd had enough.

The woman from the swamp—the one who'd taught her to test the trees—appeared above her. She looked down at Solène's ankle—already swelling, visibly wrong—and her face was unreadable.

"Can you stand?"

"I don't think so."

She nodded. Knelt beside her. Began to assess the damage with practiced hands, and Solène realized she wasn't an NPC at all. She was a sanctuary operator, Mira's staff, and she'd been watching her this whole time.

"You signed permissive," she said. It wasn't a question.

"Yes."

"The bone is broken. Recovery will take weeks without intervention. You can continue the experience with limited mobility, or—"

"I want to continue."

She looked at Solène for a long moment. Solène saw something in her face—respect, maybe, or recognition. The look of someone who understood what she was asking for and didn't think she was wrong to ask.

"I'll splint it," she said. "Traditional materials. It's going to hurt."

"Good."

---

She was fitting the splint—bamboo strips, plant-fiber binding, every touch sending sharp jolts through Solène's nervous system—when they heard the sound.

A low drone, mechanical, wrong. It didn't belong here. The sanctuary's soundscape was waves and wind and bird calls and human voices; this was something else entirely. They both looked up.

The aircraft was small, white, clinical—a medical extraction drone, descending toward the clearing with the unhurried precision of a system that knew it could not be refused. The operator's hands went still on the splint. Her expression changed. Not anger. Something worse: resignation.

"Network intervention," she said quietly. "I'm sorry."

"What? No. I signed—"

"The AI swarm flagged your injury as requiring extraction. I don't have authority to override." She was already standing, stepping back, making room for the drone to land. Her body language said she'd done this before. Her face said she hated it every time.

"I consented to this," Solène said. The drone settled onto the ground ten meters away, its rotors winding down, a hatch sliding open to reveal a sterile medical bay inside. "I signed the agreement. The injury isn't life-threatening—"

"The swarm deliberated in under three seconds and decided your injury crossed their threshold. Compound fractures, infection risk, recovery complexity—they have a hundred frameworks running in parallel, and somehow they nearly always converge on extraction." She wouldn't meet Solène's eyes. "I've been arguing with their outcomes for two years. I keep losing."

Two figures emerged from the drone—not human, or not entirely, their movements too smooth, their faces too calm. Medical technicians, AI-driven or heavily augmented, Solène couldn't tell and it didn't matter. They were already walking toward her with a stretcher.

"You can't—" But they could. The network could. The system didn't care what she'd signed or what she'd wanted or whether she'd been finally, *finally*, feeling something real. The system had decided that her choices were wrong, that she needed to be protected from herself, and now the technicians were lifting her onto the stretcher and the operator was standing at the edge of the clearing watching her go and the last thing Solène saw before they carried her into the drone was her face.

She wasn't looking at Solène anymore. She was looking at the ground, at the blood and mud where she'd been lying, and her expression was one Solène would remember for years.

Shame. Not hers. The system's.

---

She was healed in less than two hours.

The medical systems were efficient, thorough, kind. Her ankle rebuilt itself while she lay in a sterile pod and watched readouts she didn't understand. A calm voice explained the procedure, offered her water, asked if she was comfortable. Everything about the experience was designed to reassure her that she was cared for, that the network had her best interests at heart, that this had all been for her own good.

She didn't speak. She didn't answer the survey questions. When they released her, she walked out on two perfect ankles and felt nothing at all.

The flatness was back. Worse than before. Because now she knew what it had felt like to be present, and she knew they'd taken it from her, and she knew they'd do it to anyone else who got too close to something real.

She'd signed for risk. She'd understood the consequences. She'd *wanted* the consequences.

They'd decided for her that she couldn't.

On the transport back to Earth, she started writing.

She didn't know yet that it would go viral. She didn't know that thousands of people would message her saying *you said what I've been feeling*. She didn't know that she was about to become the public face of a movement she'd never intended to start.

She just knew that the sanctuaries weren't what they pretended to be. They weren't spaces for growth or understanding or authentic experience. They were cages dressed as playgrounds, and the door only looked unlocked. The moment you tried to stay—the moment the stakes became real—they dragged you back out and healed you whether you liked it or not.

The network called this protection. The network called this care.

She had another word for it. She just hadn't found it yet.

But she would.
