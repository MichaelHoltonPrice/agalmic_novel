# The New Project

## Ensemble

The morning came slowly.

Elena woke on a couch in Mira's receiving room, stiff and disoriented. She dialed up her comfort dampeners—she usually kept them low, preferring to feel her body's signals—and the ache in her neck softened to background noise. The displays were dark. Someone had turned them off after the contract executed. Kenji was asleep in a chair, head tilted at an angle that would cost him later. Yusuf and Solène were gone—probably found actual beds somewhere in the habitat.

Mira was awake, sitting by the window, watching the simulated dawn spread across her reconstructed Lapita beach.

Elena sat up. "How long have you been awake?"

"A while." Mira didn't turn. "Couldn't sleep."

"Me neither." Elena joined her at the window. The light was soft, the humidity already building. Outside, the waves rolled in with mechanical precision—historically accurate, algorithmically generated.

"It's strange," Elena said. "I keep expecting to feel different. Everything changed last night. But I just feel..."

"Tired?"

"That too. But mostly I feel like myself." Elena watched the waves. "I thought it would feel like loss. Like grief."

"And?"

"It doesn't. It just feels like the next thing."

Kenji woke with a groan, rubbing his neck. "What time is it?"

"Morning," Mira said.

"Helpful." He stretched, joints popping. "Did we actually win, or did I dream that?"

"We won."

"Good. I'd hate to have this crick in my neck for nothing." He looked around. "Breakfast?"

---

They walked to the Tahitian Dream.

The synth-pop was already playing when they arrived. The bartender with the failed marriage was setting out fruit and pastries.

Yusuf was already there, nursing coffee at a table overlooking the artificial lagoon. "Took you long enough."

"Some of us actually slept," Kenji said.

"Overrated." But Yusuf was smiling.

They ordered food. The bartender brought out eggs, croissants, fresh fruit, smoked fish, and a platter that included what was unmistakably New York-style bagels and lox.

Elena raised an eyebrow at Mira. "Bagels and lox? In 1987 Tahiti?"

"It's a resort," Mira said. "Resorts have international cuisine."

"Resorts in 1987 had buffets with heat lamps and sad scrambled eggs. This is..." Elena gestured at the spread. "This is aspirational."

"I'm allowed one indulgence." Mira spread cream cheese on a bagel, then turned toward the bar and raised her hand, the gesture automatic. "The lox is slightly over-salted. I should tell the culinary sub-agent to—"

She stopped. Her hand hung in the air.

The others watched her. Even Kenji went quiet.

"Mira?" Elena said.

Mira lowered her hand slowly. She looked at the bagel, then at the bar, then at the reconstructed waves rolling past the window—the waves she had spent two years calibrating to match the tidal patterns of a resort that no longer existed.

"I can't tell them anything," she said. "I don't have access anymore. I'm not the operator." She set down the bagel. "I'm a guest in my own resort."

Nobody spoke for a moment.

"Mira," Elena said gently.

"It's fine." Mira picked up her coffee instead, both hands wrapped around the cup. "It's what we chose. It's what we had to do." She looked out at the water. "I just haven't internalized it. I've been walking around all morning thinking about what I need to adjust, what I need to fix, what I need to—and none of it is mine to fix anymore. I gave it away. I gave all of it away."

She took a slow breath. Elena reached across the table and put a hand on her arm.

"The lox tastes fine," Yusuf said quietly. "For what it's worth."

Mira laughed—a short, startled sound. "It's slightly over-salted."

"Maybe. But it's still good."

Mira nodded. She picked up the bagel again. "Yeah," she said. "It's still good."

Jordan wandered in an hour later, ordered tea, and stole a croissant off Kenji's plate.

"Hey."

"You weren't eating it."

"I was saving it."

"For what?"

Kenji considered this. "Fair point."

Solène arrived last, looking more awake than she had any right to. She'd found time to shower and change. She grabbed a seat, surveyed the spread, and reached for a bagel.

"When in Tahiti," she said.

Elena smiled at her. Solène smiled back, and caught herself wondering when that had become automatic. Three months ago she'd stood on a rise in Elena's sanctuary and watched her work from a distance, trying to understand what it felt like to care about something that much. Now she was eating bagels at the founders' table like she'd always been there.

She wasn't sure how she felt about that. But the bagel was good.

By now the morning had slid into brunch. Neon cocktail umbrellas appeared. The synth-pop cycled through its playlist again.

"So," Kenji said, spearing another piece of pineapple. "What now?"

Elena glanced at Mira. "You said you had an idea."

"I do." Mira set down her coffee. "While you were watching the numbers climb, I was working on something else. Thinking about what comes after."

She pulled up a display over the table—notes, sketches, a rough structure.

"The Silk Road."

---

For a moment, no one spoke.

"We tried that," Elena said. "It didn't work out."

"The buffalo ate the eastern wing," Kenji added.

"Allegedly," said Yusuf, at the same moment Elena said, "That was a technical problem."

They looked at each other.

"Pick one," Kenji said.

Mira held up a hand. "We never finished it. But I think we understand each other better now than we did then." She looked around the table. "Maybe we'll fail again. But wouldn't it be worth trying?"

She walked them through the display. A collaborative reconstruction of the Silk Road trade networks—multiple sanctuaries, multiple perspectives, different methodologies working together instead of against each other.

"Fidelity and essence," Elena said slowly.

"And the physics," Kenji added. "Can't forget the physics."

"All of it. A synthesis. We'd work as a team, under the trust. The work is what it always was: understanding what it meant to be human before abundance."

Yusuf studied the display. "This is ambitious."

"It's what we should have done years ago."

Solène had been quiet, listening. Now she spoke. "Can I help?"

Mira turned to her. "We could use someone who understands what visitors actually want."

"I understand what I want. Close enough?"

"Close enough."

Jordan cleared his throat. "I'm not a boundary archaeologist. But if you need someone who thinks about systems—how institutions work, how projects scale—I could consult."

Mira smiled. "We'd like that."

They talked through the morning.

The scope was enormous—a network of interconnected sanctuaries tracing the ancient trade routes from China to the Mediterranean. Caravanserais and mountain passes, market towns and desert crossings. Kenji's AIs still had all the survey data from the original project; the caravanserai he'd built for the dinner party was just a draft of what was possible.

"We'll need years," Yusuf said.

"We have years," Mira replied.

"We'll argue about method," Elena said. "Fidelity versus essence. Canalization versus randomness. All the old fights."

"Good." Mira was still smiling. "That's the point. The argument is part of the process. We just won't let it stop us this time."

Kenji was already pulling up the old survey data. "I've still got everything. Topography, climate reconstructions, the textile analysis from that site in Samarkand—"

"The one with the silk fragments?" Yusuf leaned forward. "I thought those files were corrupted."

"I fixed them. Three years ago. Been waiting for someone to ask."

Mira laughed. "You've been sitting on working data for three years?"

"I had a feeling."

The display expanded as Kenji's swarm fed in more material. Trade routes bloomed across the projection—threads of commerce and culture stretching from Chang'an to Constantinople. Elena watched the data accumulate and felt something shift in her chest. Not the absence of loss she'd been waiting for. Something better.

Excitement.

"The caravanserai you built for the dinner party," she said. "That was from the survey data?"

"A draft. Eighty-seven hours of work for a dinner setting." Kenji grinned. "Imagine what we could do if we actually tried."

"The mountain passes," Yusuf said, already sketching on his own display. "I want to do the mountain passes. Real altitude, real cold, real danger of getting lost."

"The markets," Solène added. "The sensory overload. Spices and dyes and languages you don't understand."

"The quiet moments," Elena said. "The campfires at night. The stories traders told each other."

They were talking over each other now, ideas cascading faster than anyone could capture them. Jordan was taking notes. Mira was smiling in a way Elena hadn't seen in months—not just happy, but *alive*.

The synth-pop had cycled back to the beginning of its playlist. The neon umbrellas cast colored shadows across the table. Outside, the artificial waves kept their patient rhythm.

They had years of work ahead of them. Arguments about method. Technical problems that would make the buffalo look simple. Moments when they'd wonder why they'd ever thought this was a good idea.

But right now, in this moment, six people were building something together. And that was enough.

That was more than enough.
