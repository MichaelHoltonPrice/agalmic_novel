# Chapter 4: The Proposal

## Elena

---

The notification arrived while Elena was watching the Delgados disappear down the trail toward their evening camp.

"Elena." Echo's voice shifted register—not alarm, but attention. The particular tone that meant: *this matters*. "A governance proposal just dropped. NG-2047-31. You'll want to see this."

Elena pulled up her glasses. Governance proposals arrived monthly, and most were housekeeping: consent language updates, accessibility standards, the slow accumulation of institutional sediment. She almost dismissed it by reflex.

"Why this one?"

"It came with an attached manifesto from a group I've never seen referenced before—the Network Philosophy Working Group. And the approval pattern is already unusual."

"How so?"

"Thirty-one sanctuaries have approved in the first six hours. That's nearly forty percent of the network."

Elena stopped walking. The prairie wind moved through the grasses around her, carrying the scent of sage and distant campfire. Forty percent in six hours. For a governance proposal with an attached manifesto. That wasn't normal adoption. That was coordination.

"Show me."

---

The proposal came with an attached document—a manifesto, the notification called it, from something called the Network Philosophy Working Group. Elena had never heard of them. She opened it expecting bureaucratic throat-clearing, the usual preamble about "stakeholder alignment" and "community values."

What she found was different.

*The history of boundary archaeology reveals two broad traditions of practice, each with deep roots, each with legitimate claims to value.*

*The Tradition of Historical Fidelity holds that the sanctuary's purpose is witness: to reconstruct, as faithfully as evidence permits, what past human experience actually was. This tradition accepts that the past was not designed for contemporary comfort. Historical fidelity includes the uncomfortable, the dangerous, the morally complex.*

*The Tradition of Quintessential Experience holds that the sanctuary's purpose is transmission: to convey the meaning of past experience in forms contemporary visitors can receive. The sanctuary artist selects, compresses, and synthesizes—not to falsify, but to clarify.*

Elena read the words twice, feeling something shift in her chest. She knew these traditions. She lived inside one of them. The language was general, abstract—but she could see herself in it. The compression. The synthesis. The belief that emotional truth mattered more than exhaustive detail.

"Echo, who wrote this?"

"The document is attributed to the Network Philosophy Working Group. I can find no public record of that group's membership or formation."

"So we don't know."

"We don't know."

She kept reading.

*Quintessential experience is our tradition. This is what our network exists to provide.*

The manifesto wasn't neutral. It wasn't a survey of different approaches, offered for consideration. It was a declaration. The network had chosen—was choosing, through this document—which tradition it belonged to. Her tradition.

And then, near the end:

*We believe that emotional depth does not require physical danger. Visitors in our sanctuaries may feel the weight of historical suffering—fatigue, discomfort, exposure, the texture of hardship—without bearing its bodily consequences. Minor discomforts are part of the experience: sunburn, muscle strain, blisters, bee stings. But we do not permit injuries that require medical intervention. We do not permit broken bones. We do not permit lasting physical or emotional harm.*

Elena pulled off her glasses and held them in her hand. Just prairie now—no manifesto, no approval counts, no institutional language. Just wind and grass and the bitter taste of dust she had made. But the familiar landscape felt different. Fragile, somehow. Like a photograph she had been living inside.

"Echo."

"Yes?"

"The manifesto describes my approach. Doesn't it."

A longer pause than usual. "It describes a philosophy consistent with your design principles. It does not name you."

"But anyone who knows the field—"

"Would recognize the alignment. Yes."

Elena began walking again, faster now, her boots leaving prints in the calibrated dust. The Morrison family's campfire glowed in the distance, the daughter's silhouette visible against the light. In a few days, that girl would die. Elena had designed that death, had calibrated the mother's grief and the father's helplessness and the precise emotional weight that visitors would carry away. She believed it mattered—believed the compression served understanding.

But she had never believed it was the only way. It was her way, yes—the only way she could imagine doing the work herself. But she had sat in too many late-night conversations with Mira, with Kenji, with operators whose sanctuaries looked nothing like hers, to think that her instincts were universal truths. The network had always had room for disagreement. That was supposed to be the point.

---

The governance proposal that accompanied the manifesto was worse.

NG-2047-31, it was called—a string of letters and numbers that meant nothing and everything. Elena read it in her office, the prairie outside her window now lit by the artificial stars she had placed.

*This proposal mandates quintessential experience as a condition of network membership. Sanctuaries that cannot or choose not to operate according to these standards are not eligible for network membership.*

Not eligible. Elena understood what that meant. No access to shared infrastructure—identity systems, consent protocols, discovery services, safety tooling. You could operate independently, if you wanted to rebuild everything from scratch. Or you could join a different network, if one existed that matched your philosophy. But you couldn't stay here. The language was polite, but the message was clear: comply or leave.

Elena scrolled through the safety standards. The list of prohibited harms was specific: bone fractures, significant lacerations, burns beyond first-degree. The list of permitted discomforts was equally specific: fatigue, blisters, insect stings. The line had been drawn with care.

Mira's sanctuaries fell on the wrong side of that line.

Elena thought of all the arguments she'd had with Mira over the years—Mira insisting that some visitors needed real stakes to understand what survival had meant, Elena countering that emotional depth didn't require broken bones. They'd never agreed, and they'd never needed to. The network had room for both approaches. Kenji's reconstructions were somewhere in between; Yusuf's were wilder than Mira's. The diversity was the point.

This proposal would end that. Mira would have to abandon her approach or leave.

"The implementation timeline," Elena said. "How long is the review period?"

"Forty-five days. Standard procedure allows one hundred eighty."

"Why the acceleration?"

"The proposal cites 'clarity of network identity' and 'the upcoming recertification cycle.' It frames the expedited timeline as responsive rather than aggressive."

Elena thought about her father, about the phrase he used when institutions moved faster than people could follow: *capture-by-tempo*. The language was neutral. The timeline was not.

"How many sanctuaries have approved now?"

"Forty-seven percent, as of the last hour. The approval rate is accelerating."

"And they're approving because—"

"Likely because they already operate according to the proposed standards. For most sanctuaries, the proposal changes nothing. It simply codifies existing practice."

"And for the sanctuaries that don't already comply?"

Echo didn't answer. It didn't need to.

---

The message from Mira arrived while Elena was staring at the timeline chart, watching the approval count tick upward in real time.

*We need to talk.*

Four words. No greeting, no context. Elena had known Mira for fifteen years—had debated methodology with her, traveled to her sanctuary, watched her reconstruct the Lapita world with a precision Elena couldn't match and didn't try to. They disagreed about almost everything. They respected each other completely.

Mira wouldn't have sent this message lightly.

Elena looked at the approval chart one more time. Fifty-one percent now. Rising. The proposal would likely pass even if she did nothing—the numbers were already there, the momentum building. She could stay in American Tapestry, tend her prairie, let the network decide what it wanted to be.

Or she could go to Mira.

"Echo, book transit to Lapita Horizons."

"That's a two-day journey each way. You won't be able to work with visitors or make physical adjustments to the sanctuary for nearly a week."

"I know."

"The Hernandez family arrives in six days for their scheduled experience."

"Reschedule them. Tell them I had an institutional matter to attend to."

A pause. Then: "Transit booked. Departure in four hours."

Elena closed the proposal document. The prairie outside her window stretched toward its artificial horizon, beautiful and coherent and exactly what she had made it. She had spent six years building this place, layering detail onto detail, calibrating dust and grief and the bitter taste of a history that might otherwise be forgotten.

And now someone wanted to make sure everyone's sanctuaries worked the same way.

---

The transit pod departed before dawn.

Elena watched American Tapestry shrink in the viewport, the cylinder's interior folding in on itself until it was just a bright arc against the black. Two days to Lapita Horizons. Two days to figure out what she would say to Mira, and what she was prepared to do about a proposal that would benefit her and harm her friend.

The journey itself was a message. She could have called Mira. Instead she was spending four days in transit—time she couldn't recover, work she would have to postpone. Mira would understand what that meant. The cost of the trip was part of the conversation.

Somewhere behind her, in a reconstructed tent on a reconstructed prairie, the Morrison daughter was waking to a morning that would bring no relief. The fever would hold for another day, then break, then return worse than before. Elena had designed every beat of that arc. She believed in it. She believed the visitors who walked through that grief came out understanding something true.

But Mira believed the same thing about her work—that fidelity required something Elena's approach didn't. They had argued about it for years, never agreeing, never needing to. Until now, the network had room for both.

The proposal would change that. And the worst part was, Elena could see why someone might think it should.

She wondered what it would feel like when everyone's sanctuaries tasted the same.
