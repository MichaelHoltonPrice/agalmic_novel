# The Climb

## Ensemble

Twenty-five percent.

Elena watched the number on the display and tried to remember what it had felt like to be stuck at eleven. That had been—what, three days ago? Four? Time had lost its shape since they signed the contract.

"It's accelerating," Kenji said. He had charts now, trend lines his swarm had generated. "The rate of new engagement is higher than the rate yesterday. We're in the steep part of the curve."

"How steep?" Mira asked.

"If this holds, we cross fifty percent by tomorrow evening."

No one said anything. Fifty percent had seemed impossible when they started. Now it was a waypoint, a milestone on the road to sixty-seven.

The story cascaded through communities they'd never reached before.

Sanctuary enthusiasts shared the contract with detailed analysis of what the IP release would mean for the field. Governance researchers wrote threads about the User Veto mechanism and its unprecedented activation. People who'd never heard of boundary archaeology encountered the story through general interest feeds—founders destroying their own advantage for a principle, the kind of dramatic sacrifice that cut through the noise.

Memes appeared. Someone had made an animation of a peacock lighting its own tail on fire. Someone else had created a parody governance proposal: "NG-2047-32: Mandatory Sacrifice Standards." The humor was dark, but the attention was real.

Counter-arguments emerged too. Defenders of the proposal accused the founders of emotional manipulation, of using spectacle to override democratic process. "The operators voted seventy-one percent in favor," one thread read. "Why should a handful of founders override the will of the majority?" The debate was fierce, polarized, alive.

The collective network of humans and AIs was paying attention.

---

Thirty-five percent.

Jordan was watching the displays with the rest of them, his systems theorist's eye tracking the shape of the curve.

"Classic sigmoid," he said. "You're in the acceleration phase now. It'll feel like it could go on forever—but it won't. The easy conversions come first: people who were already inclined to agree, who just needed a reason to pay attention. Once they're in, you hit the harder cases."

"When does it flatten?" Elena asked.

"Watch for it around forty-five, fifty percent. That's typically where the inflection happens, where the second derivative equals zero."

---

Forty-two percent.

Solène had become something like their communications lead, though no one had formally assigned her the role. She monitored the open chain feeds, tracked the commentary threads, flagged stories that were gaining traction.

"There's a counter-movement forming," she reported. "Operators who supported the proposal are organizing. They're arguing that the User Veto is being manipulated by celebrity influence—that the founders are using their fame to override democratic legitimacy."

"Are they wrong?" Yusuf asked.

Solène looked at him. "Does it matter?"

"It might. If they feel like we stole the process—"

"We didn't steal anything." Mira's voice was sharp. "The User Veto exists for exactly this reason. It's a check on operator capture. The mechanism is working as designed."

"That's what we believe. That's not what they believe."

The argument didn't resolve. It didn't need to. The numbers kept climbing.

---

Fifty percent.

They gathered in Mira's receiving room to mark the milestone—not with celebration, but with a kind of grim acknowledgment. Halfway there. Seventeen percent to go.

"The curve is flattening," Kenji said. His charts showed it clearly now: the steep climb of the past two days was leveling off. "We're past the inflection point. The rate of new engagement is declining."

"How fast?"

"Hard to say. The model suggests we'll keep gaining, but slower. A lot slower."

Elena asked Echo to do some quick modeling. They had maybe thirty-six hours until the resolution window closed. They needed seventeen more points. At the current rate...

"It's going to be close," she said.

"Very close," Kenji agreed.

---

The next day was agony.

Fifty-three percent. Fifty-five. Fifty-seven. Each point harder than the last. The people who were going to be reached had been reached; the people who were going to be persuaded had been persuaded. Increasingly, what remained were the genuinely indifferent—users who would never vote on governance, who had filtered the entire topic out of their attention—and the actively opposed, those who believed the proposal was right and the founders were wrong.

Fifty-nine percent.

Sixty.

Elena stopped watching the displays. She couldn't bear the weight of each decimal point. She walked the beach at Lapita Horizons instead, letting the humid air wrap around her, feeling the sand between her toes.

Mira found her there.

"Sixty-one percent," Mira said. "Kenji thinks we'll hit sixty-three by evening."

"And then?"

"And then it gets even harder." Mira stood beside her, looking out at the waves.

"What's the ceiling?"

"Kenji's swarm estimates sixty-six to sixty-eight percent as the maximum achievable participation. We're inside the range now."

"What are you working on?" Elena asked. "You've been heads-down on something for days."

Mira was quiet for a moment. "Something for after. Either way."

"Will you tell me?"

"When it's ready."

---

The final hours.

They gathered again in the receiving room. All of them this time—Elena, Mira, Kenji, Yusuf, Solène. The displays showed the User Veto dashboard, the resolution window countdown, the open chain feeds still churning with commentary.

Sixty-four percent.

The resolution window would close at midnight. Six hours left.

"We need three more points," Kenji said. He had stopped generating projections. The models were useless now; they were in territory no model had ever mapped.

Sixty-four point three.

Sixty-four point seven.

The numbers moved like molasses. Each tenth of a percent felt like a victory and a reminder of how far they still had to go.

"I can't watch this," Solène said. But she didn't leave.

Sixty-five percent.

Four hours left. Two points to go.

Either way, they paid the price. That was what made it honest.

Sixty-five point four.

Sixty-five point eight.

Sixty-six percent.

Three hours left. One point to go.

The room was silent except for the soft hum of the environmental systems. No one spoke. There was nothing left to say.

Sixty-six point two.

Sixty-six point five.

Sixty-six point seven.

Two hours left.

Sixty-six point nine.

Elena held her breath.

Sixty-seven percent.

The display flickered. New text appeared:

*USER VETO THRESHOLD REACHED — 67.0%*

*Proposal NG-2047-31 will be blocked unless veto falls below threshold before window closes.*

*Resolution window closes in 1 hour, 47 minutes.*

For a long moment, no one moved.

"Users can still change their votes," Kenji said softly. "Technically. Until the window closes." He looked around the room. "But they won't. Not enough of them, at least."

Then louder: "We did it!"

Mira sat very still, a small smile spreading across her face. Solène was grinning.

And Yusuf—morose, pessimistic Yusuf, who always saw the negatives first—whooped. Elena couldn't remember the last time she'd heard that.

She felt lighter than she had in weeks.

And in less than two hours, their contract would execute. Their IP would enter the public domain. Their sanctuaries would transfer to the trust.

They had won, and they had paid the price.

---

The resolution window closed at midnight UTC.

They watched the timestamp tick over—the moment when votes became final and could no longer be changed. The veto had held: proposal blocked, outcome certified, permanently recorded.

And then, a moment later, the smart contract executed.

*Transfer complete.*

*Schedule A: 87,000+ intellectual property assets released to public domain.*

*Schedule B: Physical infrastructure transferred to Agalmic Commons Trust.*

*Transaction finalized. Irreversible.*

"So," Kenji said, breaking the silence. "What now?"

They looked at each other. The question hung in the air, unanswered.

Then Mira smiled—a real smile, the first Elena had seen from her in weeks.

"I have an idea," she said.
