# Chapter 2: The Visit

## Solène

I know what I'm looking for. I just don't know if it exists.

The transit pod releases me into the arrival bay, and I stand for a moment in the threshold, letting the pressure equalize. Through the viewport, the cylinder's interior curves away in both directions—thirty kilometers of reconstructed American prairie, the grasses rippling under a wind I can't yet feel. The horizon bends upward at the edges, a reminder that this is a container, not a world. Most visitors stop noticing after a few hours. I never do.

This is my seventh sanctuary in three months. I've walked through the temple reconstructions at Angkor. I've stood in a Florentine workshop while a behavioral model of Leonardo explained fresco technique. I've felt the spray of simulated ocean in a dozen different enclaves. Each time, I've felt something—admiration, sometimes awe, occasionally a sharp stab of beauty that takes my breath away.

And each time, I've left still searching.

The entry gate opens, and the prairie swallows me whole.

The dust is the first thing I notice. It tastes bitter, metallic, wrong in a way that feels *right*. Someone has thought carefully about this dust. Someone has calibrated it to evoke failure and longing, the particular despair of people walking toward a horizon they might never reach.

I appreciate the craft. I always appreciate the craft.

The wagon trail stretches ahead, rutted and sun-baked, and I follow it because that's what visitors do. My cortics feed me contextual information—dates, routes, mortality statistics—but I've learned to dim that stream when I'm in sanctuaries. The data interferes with whatever I'm trying to feel. Or trying to fail to feel. I'm not always sure which.

Other visitors move along the trail ahead of me. A family—two parents, two adult children—walking with the careful attention of people who traveled days to be here. The parents' postures are different from the children's: tighter, more alert. They remember something the children don't. They're here to share that memory, or maybe to prove it still matters.

The children walk like I walk. Smooth. Unhurried. Waiting for something to happen.

I wonder if they'll find what they're looking for. I wonder if they know what that is. I wonder if I do.

An hour in, I reach a wagon that's been staged as aftermath.

The fire has burned down to embers. A family—NPCs, behavioral models, I can see the tells if I look closely—is emerging from their tent, packing their belongings for another day's travel. Father checking the oxen. Mother wrapping flour in oilcloth. And a girl, maybe eight years old, coughing into her sleeve.

I stop walking.

The girl's face is flushed. Her movements are slower than her parents'. She's sick—really sick, in the fiction of this place—and anyone paying attention can see where this is going. The parents don't seem to notice yet. They're focused on the practical work of survival: the yokes, the flour, the endless preparation for a journey that grinds you down one step at a time.

The girl looks up. She sees me watching. And she smiles.

It's a good smile. Procedurally generated, probably, but calibrated to feel authentic. The smile of a child who doesn't know she's dying, or who knows and has decided to be brave about it. My cortics could tell me which interpretation the designers intended. I don't ask.

I feel something.

It takes me a moment to identify it: admiration. For the construction. For the emotional engineering that produced this moment—the careful staging of grief-to-come, the way the parents' obliviousness heightens the tragedy, the precise angle of morning light that makes the girl's face glow like a Renaissance portrait.

I admire it. I recognize what it's doing to me. And in recognizing it, I step outside of it.

The exit is always there. I could leave right now—walk back to the entry gate, take a pod to the station, be home in a day. Nothing is stopping me. Nothing is at stake. The girl will die whether I watch or not, and her death will mean exactly what it was designed to mean, no more and no less.

But maybe that's unfair. Maybe I'm asking the wrong thing of this place. It's not trying to put me in danger—it's trying to help me understand what danger felt like for people who had no choice. That's a different goal. Maybe I should meet it on its own terms.

I came here to feel something real. I'm feeling something beautiful. Maybe I'm the problem, not the sanctuary.

Later, I climb a low rise to get a better view of the trail.

The landscape feels compressed somehow—too many biomes visible at once. I wonder if it's composite, and my cortics confirm: Nebraska prairie bleeding into Wyoming foothills bleeding into Nevada alkali flats, a thousand miles compressed into thirty kilometers. The designers prioritized emotional logic over cartographic accuracy. It works, mostly. The sense of distance is real. The sense of exhaustion is real. The sense of hope-against-odds is real.

But the hope is borrowed. The exhaustion is optional. And I'm not sure that's a flaw. Maybe it's just... different. Maybe I need to stop comparing curated experience to something it's not trying to be.

A woman stands on a rise across from me, maybe half a kilometer away. She's dressed in period clothing—wool trousers, rough-spun shirt, boots that have been aged to look like they've walked a thousand miles. She seems to be talking to the air, gesturing occasionally, her posture that of someone in conversation with an invisible partner.

She belongs here in a way I don't. Not because of the costume—I could dress like that if I wanted—but because of how she *moves*. She's not visiting. She's not observing. She's *working*. This is her place. She made it.

I don't know who she is. I don't approach. But I watch her for a while, trying to understand what it would feel like to care about something this much. To spend years calibrating dust, staging grief, building a world out of longing and bitter aftertaste.

It seems exhausting. It seems beautiful. It seems like exactly the kind of devotion I've never been able to muster for anything.

I leave American Tapestry as the artificial sun begins its programmed descent toward the habitat's axis.

The pod back to the station is quiet. My cortics offer me satisfaction surveys, feedback forms, curated highlights from my visit. I dismiss them all. I don't know how to rate an experience I can't quite name.

The sanctuary was beautiful. The craft was undeniable. Whoever built this place—the woman on the rise, or someone like her—poured something genuine into it. I felt echoes of that genuineness everywhere I walked.

But echoes aren't the thing itself. Or maybe they are, and I just can't hear them right.

I've been doing this for years now. Visiting sanctuaries. Hoping that this time, *this* time, something will catch. That the curated experience will somehow transmit what I'm missing, that I'll find in these careful reconstructions whatever it is that my parents' generation found in actual scarcity.

It hasn't happened yet. But maybe I haven't been looking in the right places. American Tapestry is designed for emotional pacing—careful, protective, calibrated. I've heard there are enclaves that work differently. Lapita Horizons, for one. Mira Chen's place. They say she offers permissive-tier experiences for visitors who want something closer to real stakes. Physical challenge. Actual risk.

Maybe that's what I need. Not curated beauty, but genuine possibility of failure.

The question settles over me as the pod accelerates toward the transit station: *Is the problem the sanctuaries, or is the problem me?*

I don't know yet. But I'm not ready to stop looking.

Behind me, the cylinder grows smaller in the viewport, its prairie folding in on itself until it's just a bright sliver against the black. I came here to feel something real. I felt something beautiful instead.

I'm not sure what that means. But I'm going to find out.
