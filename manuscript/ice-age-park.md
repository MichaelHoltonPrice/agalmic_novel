# Ice Age Park

## Elena

---

The mammoths were real.

Elena pressed her face against the observation barrier, breath fogging the reinforced glass, and watched them move across the Montana grassland like something from a dream that had decided to stay. The morning light caught the red-brown of their shaggy coats, turned the tusks to ivory arcs against the blue horizon. A calf stumbled on uneven ground and its mother paused, trunk curling down to steady it, and Elena felt her chest go tight with something she didn't have a name for.

"Elena." Her father's hand found her shoulder. "You can breathe. They'll still be there."

She took a breath. The calf had found its footing. The herd moved on, unhurried, massive, *alive*.

"I know," she said. "I just—"

"I know."

Jordan Smith stood beside her, fifty-eight years old with the body of a man half that age—one of the first generation to truly benefit from the longevity treatments that had become routine in the year since everything changed. He watched his daughter watching the mammoths, and she could feel the weight of his attention even when she didn't look up. Her father was always watching. Always thinking about what he saw.

Around them, other visitors drifted through Ice Age Park's welcome center, moving toward the viewing platforms or the interactive exhibits or the café that served historically-inspired food no one really wanted to eat. There had been no tickets to buy, no costs to navigate—just the journey here, the choice to come, and now this: standing at the edge of something that shouldn't exist.

"When I was your age," Jordan said, "places like this were impossible."

"I know." Elena had heard this before. The world had been different. Things had cost money. Not everyone could go everywhere. It sounded like a story from a very long time ago, even though her father had lived it.

"No, I mean—" He paused, choosing words the way he always did, like each one mattered. "Not just expensive. *Impossible*. The technology didn't exist. The knowledge didn't exist. A year ago, none of this existed. And now—"

He gestured at the grassland beyond the glass, where twelve thousand years of extinction had been undone in a handful of years.

"Now it's just a park," Elena said.

"Now it's a miracle wearing comfortable clothes."

She looked up at him. Her father smiled, the small careful smile that meant he was pleased with his own phrasing. Elena's glasses—her new glasses, slim titanium frames that connected her to Echo and the park's information systems—flickered with data she didn't need yet. She blinked it away. Through the earbuds, she heard Echo's voice, soft and formal, still learning her rhythms: *Shall I provide context about the de-extinction process?*

Not now, she thought. The subvocal pickup caught it, transmitted silence.

*Acknowledged.*

Echo was new. Elena had been assigned an AI companion three weeks ago, part of the Universal Basic Services that had rolled out so quickly it felt like weather—something that had always been there, even though she remembered when it hadn't been. The voice was pleasant, the knowledge vast, the presence still strange. Like having a very smart friend who lived in her ear and didn't yet know when to be quiet.

"Can we go outside?" she asked. "Where the wolves are?"

---

The dire wolves moved like smoke through the tall grass.

Elena crouched at the edge of the viewing area, her knees pressing into soil that smelled of earth and something animal, and watched the pack work their way toward the feeding station. There were seven of them—large, thick-bodied, their coats a mottled gray-brown that seemed to shift with the light. The lead wolf paused, lifted its head, and for a moment Elena could have sworn it was looking directly at her.

*Canis dirus*, Echo said in her ear. *The dire wolf. Extinct for approximately 11,700 years until the first successful de-extinction births in 2027. This pack is third-generation. Their behavioral patterns are largely derived from gray wolf templates, but researchers have noted some distinct—*

"Quiet," Elena whispered. "Please."

*Acknowledged.*

The wolf lowered its head and moved on. The pack followed, and Elena watched them until they disappeared into the distant tree line, their movements coordinated, purposeful, *alive*. They had been gone for thousands of years. Now they were here, and she was watching them, and somehow that was just a thing that could happen.

"The technology that made this possible came together so fast." Jordan had settled onto a bench nearby, his long legs stretched out, his face turned toward the same vista Elena couldn't stop watching. "Just last year, none of this existed. Not the wolves, not the mammoths, not the understanding of ancient DNA that let us fill in the gaps with modern templates. The Convergence changed everything."

"You keep saying that."

"Because I keep being surprised that it's true." He laughed, a quiet sound. "I've spent my whole life studying systems—how they change, how they collapse, how they find new equilibria. And then the biggest shift in human history happens in what feels like an afternoon, and I'm just... here. Watching wolves with my daughter."

Elena turned to look at him. "Do you miss it? The way things were?"

Jordan considered the question the way he considered everything—slowly, thoroughly, giving it the attention it deserved. "I miss some things. I miss the feeling that effort mattered, that choices had costs. Everything now is—" He paused, searching. "Abundant. Easy. That's good, mostly. But sometimes I wonder what we lose when we lose the friction."

Elena didn't fully understand. She remembered the time before—she had been ten when the Convergence began, old enough to notice that her parents had stopped worrying about certain things, that the news had shifted from disasters to possibilities, that the world had become strange in a way that felt like waking up. But she didn't remember it the way her father did, as loss. To her, the old world was a place in stories, and this world—wolves and mammoths and AI companions and the endless grassland curving toward a horizon where everything was possible—was simply where she lived.

"The wolves don't care about friction," she said finally.

Jordan smiled. "No. They just care about being wolves."

*The pack has reached the feeding station*, Echo reported. *Shall I provide details about their dietary requirements?*

Elena watched the last wolf disappear. "No," she said. "But thank you for asking."

---

The river crossing began with sound.

Elena heard it before she understood what she was hearing: a low rumble that seemed to come from the ground itself, a vibration that traveled up through her shoes and settled somewhere behind her sternum. She was walking beside her father on one of the park's winding paths, the afternoon light golden and thick, when the world began to shake.

"There," Jordan said, and pointed.

The mammoths emerged from the tree line.

There were a dozen of them, maybe more—Elena lost count as they resolved from distant shapes into impossible reality. The matriarch led, her tusks sweeping the air, her trunk testing the ground ahead. Behind her came the others: cows and calves and adolescents, a family in motion, their footfalls creating the rhythm that Elena felt in her bones.

She had seen the mammoths from the observation deck. She had watched them through the glass, safely distant, comfortably contained. This was different. This was standing in the open air while a herd of animals that had been dead for twelve thousand years walked toward a river crossing fifty meters away.

"Oh," she said. It was the only word she had.

Jordan put his arm around her shoulders, and they stood together on the ridge overlooking the river, and they watched.

The matriarch reached the water's edge. She paused there, trunk dipping down to test the current, and behind her the herd slowed, waiting. A calf pressed close to its mother's side—the same calf Elena had seen that morning, or one like it, small and awkward and completely trusting. The mother's trunk curled around it, a gesture of reassurance that needed no translation.

Then the matriarch stepped forward, and the crossing began.

The water came up to their bellies, cold and fast with snowmelt from mountains Elena couldn't see. The calves struggled against the current, their mothers positioning themselves upstream to break the flow. One adolescent lost its footing and was steadied by an aunt—or that was how Elena imagined the relationship, watching the larger animal press against the smaller one until balance was restored. They moved together, the whole family, each member finding their place in the formation, the matriarch never looking back but somehow always knowing where everyone was.

Elena's eyes were burning. She didn't realize she was crying until she felt the tears on her cheeks, and she didn't try to wipe them away. Her glasses were recording, Echo was silent, and somewhere in her chest something was blooming that she would spend the rest of her life trying to understand.

*This was real.*

Not the original real—she was old enough to understand that. These were echoes, reconstructions, ancient DNA woven together with modern templates to create something that resembled what had been lost. The mammoths walking through the river were not the same mammoths who had walked here twelve thousand years ago. Their memories were not inherited. Their culture, whatever culture mammoths had possessed, had died with the last of them.

But they were here. Breathing, walking, crossing a river while their calves struggled against the current. *Someone had cared enough to bring them back.*

"Dad," she said, and her voice cracked.

"I know." His arm tightened around her shoulders. "I know."

They stood there until the last mammoth had climbed the far bank, until the herd had reformed on the other side, until the matriarch had turned to count her family and found them all accounted for. The sun was lower now, the light turning amber, and Elena felt like she had been standing on this ridge for years.

"Someone made this," she said finally. "Someone decided to—to *do* this."

"Yes."

"Why?"

Jordan was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was careful, the way it got when he was saying something he wanted her to remember.

"Because loss doesn't have to be permanent," he said. "Because the past doesn't have to stay gone. Because sometimes—" He paused, and she saw that his eyes were wet too. "Because sometimes people care enough to bring back what was lost. Not the original thing. Nothing can do that. But something that remembers what the original was like. Something that carries its shape forward into a world that forgot."

Elena watched the mammoths move away from the river, the calves now on the outside of the formation, the adults surrounding them. The family as a structure. The herd as a choice.

"I want to do this," she said. "I want to make this my life's work."

Jordan looked down at her. "Make what? De-extinction?"

"No." She shook her head, frustrated by the inadequacy of words. "Not the biology part. The—the *this* part. The standing on a ridge and watching something that was lost and isn't anymore. The feeling like the world is bigger than you thought it was." She took a breath. "I want to give that feeling to other people."

Her father didn't respond right away. He looked at the mammoths, now small shapes against the distant grass, and then he looked at the sky, and then he looked at her.

"That's a good thing to want," he said.

The exhibit about the First Americans was smaller than Elena expected.

After the mammoths, after the wonder, she had assumed everything else would feel insufficient. But her father had steered them toward the interpretive center as the light began to fade, and now she stood before a display of stone tools that fit in the palm of her hand, and she felt the wonder return in a different shape.

*Clovis points*, read the display. *13,000 years old. Found throughout North America.*

The tools were beautiful—fluted spearheads, precisely knapped, their edges still sharp enough to cut after all those millennia. Elena leaned close to the glass, examining the craftsmanship. Someone had made these. Someone had held them in their hands, had shaped them with patient skill, had carried them across a landscape where mammoths and dire wolves were simply *there*, part of the world, animals you hunted or avoided or watched from a safe distance.

*The Clovis culture*, Echo said in her ear, unprompted but not unwelcome. *Named for the site near Clovis, New Mexico where the first points were discovered. These people were among the first humans to inhabit North America, arriving via the land bridge from Asia during the last Ice Age. They coexisted with the megafauna for approximately two thousand years.*

"Coexisted," Elena repeated softly.

*Yes. There is debate about the role of human hunting in the megafauna extinctions, but the archaeological record is clear that Clovis people and Pleistocene animals overlapped for a significant period. They would have known these creatures as part of their everyday world.*

Elena looked up at the diorama behind the display case: a painted scene showing small human figures on a ridge, spears in hand, watching a mammoth herd cross a river. The composition was familiar. The ridge, the river, the family of giants moving through the current. Someone had stood where she had stood. Someone had watched what she had watched.

But they had not been visitors.

"Dad," she said. "The people. The ones who made these tools."

"The Clovis people." Jordan was examining a different display, but he turned at her voice.

"They watched the mammoths." Elena touched the glass in front of the diorama, her fingertip landing on one of the tiny painted figures. "They saw what I saw. Except for them it wasn't a park. It wasn't special. It was just—"

"Their world."

"Yes." She pulled her hand back, leaving a smudge on the glass. "Can we bring them back too? The people?"

Jordan's expression shifted, something complicated moving through his eyes. "No. We can't."

"Why not? If we can bring back mammoths—"

"A mammoth is biology." He moved closer, lowering himself to her eye level the way he did when something mattered. "DNA and cells and reconstruction. A person is more than that. A person is—memory. Language. Culture. All the things they knew and believed and understood about their world. That dies with them. No amount of DNA can bring it back."

Elena felt something fall inside her, a small disappointment. "Then they're really gone. Forever."

"The people themselves? Yes." Jordan reached out and tapped the glass, his finger landing beside hers, touching the painted river. "But what they experienced? How they understood the world? We can try to reconstruct that. Not perfectly. Never perfectly. But we can help people understand what it might have felt like to be them. To live in a world where mammoths were just animals, and you were just a person, and the whole future was still unwritten."

Elena stared at the diorama. The tiny figures on the ridge. The mammoths in the river. The sky above them all, the same sky that curved overhead right now, the same sun that would set in an hour.

"That's what I want to do," she said. Her voice had changed, steadied, found something it hadn't had before. "Not bring back the animals. Bring back what it felt like to be someone who knew them. To *understand*."

Jordan smiled. It was a different smile than before—not proud, exactly, but something adjacent to it. Recognizing.

"That's a harder thing to want," he said. "And a better one."

They walked back toward the transit station as the sky turned purple and gold.

Elena's legs were tired in a good way, the kind of tired that meant she had used them, had walked through a world that rewarded walking. Her glasses were dim now, Echo quiet, the park settling into its evening rhythms around them. In the distance, she could hear something—a wolf howl, maybe, or just the wind moving through grass that had been carefully calibrated to sound like something ancient.

"Thank you," she said. "For bringing me here."

"You're welcome." Jordan's hand found hers, a gesture that felt both old and appropriate. "Where should we go next? There's talk of building whole prairies in space now. Can you imagine? Habitats that curve upward at the horizon. Grasslands that wrap around you like a cylinder."

Elena tried to imagine it: the world bending upward, the sky a strip of light along the center, mammoths walking on ground that curved away in every direction.

"Would the animals know?" she asked. "That they weren't on Earth?"

"The animals would know they were home. That's what matters."

They walked in silence for a while, the transit station growing closer, the day pulling toward its end. Elena thought about the Clovis people, standing on a ridge that no longer existed, watching mammoths that were gone for millennia until someone decided they didn't have to be. She thought about her father's words: *you can help people understand what it felt like*.

*Elena*, Echo said. *Before we leave—would you like me to compile resources about the First Americans? Archaeological records, linguistic reconstructions, settlement patterns?*

Elena considered. The question felt different now than it had that morning. Then, Echo had been a stranger, a presence in her ear she didn't know how to use. Now—

"Yes," she said. "Everything. Start at the beginning."

*The beginning is approximately 20,000 years ago, when the first humans began crossing from Asia into the Americas. However, there is significant debate about earlier migration patterns, and some evidence suggests—*

"Not that beginning." Elena cut in, but gently. "The beginning of what we *know*. The first records, the first discoveries. I want to understand how we learned about them. How we figured out they were there."

A pause. Echo learning something.

*Acknowledged*, the AI said. *I will compile the historiographical record alongside the archaeological evidence. This will provide context for how our understanding developed over time.*

"Thank you."

*You are welcome.*

Jordan glanced at her, a question in the look. Elena shrugged, a little embarrassed.

"I want to learn," she said. "All of it. How they lived, what they knew, how we found out about them. And then—"

She paused. The transit station was ahead, humming with the clean energy that powered everything now, that made possible things that would have been impossible a year ago. The sky was darkening, the first stars emerging, and somewhere behind her the mammoths were settling in for the night, the wolves were ranging through the shadows, the ancient past was alive and walking in the present.

"And then I want to figure out how to show other people," she said. "What it felt like to be them. What it felt like to live in a world where all this—" She gestured behind her, at the park, at the impossible creatures, at the twelve thousand years that had been undone. "Was just *there*. Normal. Home."

Jordan squeezed her hand.

"You'll need to learn a lot," he said. "Archaeology. History. How to build things that feel true even when they're reconstructions. It's not easy work."

"I don't want easy work." Elena looked up at the stars. She tried to imagine them curving, wrapping around a world someone had built. Prairies in space. History in cylinders. The past, saved. "I want work that matters."

They entered the transit station. The doors closed behind them. And Elena Smith, eleven years old, carried the mammoths home with her—not in her memory, but in the place where memories turned into purposes, where wonder turned into will.

She didn't know yet what she would build. She only knew that she would build something.

It would be enough.
