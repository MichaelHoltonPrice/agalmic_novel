# Network Governance Proposal NG-2047-31

## Sanctuary Standards and Safety Framework

*Submitted to the Guardian Triad for binding review*

---

## Summary

This proposal codifies our network's commitment to quintessential sanctuary design and visitor safety. It establishes mandatory standards for all sanctuaries operating within the network, ensuring alignment with the principles articulated in *Toward a Philosophy of Sanctuary Design*.

This proposal mandates specific design philosophy. Sanctuaries within our network must operate according to the quintessential tradition. Historical fidelity approaches that require significant physical risk are not compatible with network membership.

---

## Section 1: Design Philosophy Standards

### 1.1 Network Identity

All sanctuaries within the network shall operate according to the quintessential (essential experience) tradition:

- **Emotional accessibility**: Experiences designed to be receivable by visitors without specialized preparation
- **Narrative coherence**: Compressed or synthesized historical content that emphasizes meaning over exhaustive detail
- **Recovery integration**: Built-in pacing that allows visitors to process intense experiences before proceeding
- **Safety-compatible immersion**: Deep engagement that does not require exposure to significant physical risk

### 1.2 Non-Compliance

Sanctuaries that cannot or choose not to operate according to these standards are not eligible for network membership. This is not a punitive measure; it reflects the network's identity as articulated in the foundational manifesto.

Operators seeking to offer historical fidelity experiences with authentic physical risk are encouraged to explore networks designed for that purpose.

---

## Section 2: Safety Standards

### 2.1 Physical Safety Requirements

All sanctuaries within the network shall maintain the following safety standards:

**Permitted discomforts** (part of the quintessential experience):
- Fatigue and muscle strain
- Minor sun exposure and weather effects
- Blisters, calluses, and minor skin irritation
- Insect bites and stings (non-dangerous species)
- Hunger and thirst sensations (with hydration available)
- Emotional intensity without limit

**Prohibited harms** (incompatible with network standards):
- Bone fractures
- Significant lacerations requiring medical intervention
- Burns beyond first-degree
- Infection risk from environmental exposure
- Any injury requiring extraction for treatment
- Any condition that would leave lasting physical effects

### 2.2 Intervention Protocols

Sanctuary systems shall be designed to prevent prohibited harms before they occur. This includes:
- Environmental safeguards (fall protection, temperature limits, hazard removal)
- Real-time monitoring with automatic intervention triggers
- Operator training in harm prevention

Extraction for medical treatment represents a system failure, not a success. Sanctuaries experiencing repeated extractions will undergo safety review.

### 2.3 Emotional Safety

Emotional intensity is encouraged. Visitors may experience grief, fear, exhaustion, moral complexity, and profound discomfort. These are features, not bugs.

However, sanctuaries shall provide:
- Clear communication about emotional content before entry
- Recovery spaces within the experience
- Exit accessibility at all times without penalty
- Post-experience support resources

---

## Section 3: Consent Architecture

### 3.1 Simplified Consent

Because the network does not offer experiences with significant physical risk, consent protocols are simplified:

- Visitors acknowledge emotional intensity
- Visitors acknowledge permitted discomforts
- Visitors confirm understanding that prohibited harms are prevented, not chosen

**There is no permissive tier.** The network does not offer experiences where visitors consent to significant physical injury.

### 3.2 Consent Friction

Consent interfaces shall be designed for genuine understanding:
- Plain language explanation of what to expect
- Visual or experiential previews where feasible
- Opportunity for questions answered by qualified staff

---

## Section 4: Implementation Timeline

### 4.1 Adoption Schedule

- **Day 0**: Proposal ratification by Guardian Triad
- **Day 30**: Operating Company issues implementation guidance
- **Day 60**: New sanctuary registrations must comply with framework
- **Day 90**: Existing sanctuaries must file compliance attestation

### 4.2 Non-Compliant Sanctuaries

Sanctuaries currently operating with permissive-tier experiences or historical fidelity approaches that permit significant physical risk must either:
- Modify their operations to comply with network standards, or
- Transition to a network compatible with their approach

The Operating Company will provide transition support, including referrals to appropriate alternative networks.

### 4.3 Expedited Review

Given the importance of clarifying network identity, this proposal is submitted for expedited Guardian review. The standard 180-day deliberation period is waived in favor of a 45-day review, with public comment accepted during the first 30 days.

Expedited review is appropriate because:
- The proposal codifies existing network values rather than introducing new ones
- Clarity benefits all stakeholders, including those who may choose to transition elsewhere
- The recertification cycle provides a natural implementation milestone

---

## Section 5: Governance Notes

### 5.1 Reversibility

This framework may be modified through standard governance procedures. However, given that it codifies network identity, modification should require demonstrated consensus that the network's fundamental purpose has changed.

### 5.2 Audit Provisions

The Operating Company shall publish annual reports on:
- Safety incidents (aiming for zero extractions)
- Sanctuary transitions (in and out of network)
- Visitor satisfaction and depth metrics

### 5.3 Amendment Procedures

Amendments to this framework require:
- Proposal submission to the Operating Company
- 90-day public comment period
- Guardian Triad review
- Supermajority (2/3) approval

---

## Appendix A: Rationale Summary

This proposal responds to ongoing confusion about network identity. Some visitors and operators have understood our network as neutral between design philosophies, offering both quintessential and historical fidelity approaches. This understanding is incorrect.

Our network exists to provide quintessential experiences with guaranteed safety. This is not a compromise or a default; it is our purpose. Codifying this purpose serves:

- **Visitors**: Clear expectations about what our network offers
- **Operators**: Clear standards for network membership
- **The broader community**: Clarity about which networks serve which traditions

We respect the historical fidelity tradition. We simply do not practice it.
